Abstract
This thesis investigates the performance of Gaussian processes (GP) in the
context of Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), the
state-of-the-art evolutionary optimization method for black-box continuous op-
timization, using niching functions from the CEC 2013 competition, which are
characterized by a high number of local optima. It describes the integration
of CMA-ES and GP surrogate model and compares its performance to Model
Guided Sampling Optimization.
