Salzella is a domain specific declarative language. Its primary focus lies in the field of music generation. The key principle upon which the language is built can be summarized as follows: For any existing piece of music it should be possible to create a Salzella program which will describe it in a way that running this program will output a piece of music similar to the original. Salzella programs are presumed to be generated rather then written by hand. The sole purpose of Salzella is to make creation of music generating tools easier. Bundling Salzella interpreter with music generating software and using it as an engine can provide a significant level of abstraction and thus make the development of such software a lot easier. Tools built on top of Salzella can generate Salzella programs and let the interpreter worry about the actual music generation. The key structural property of Salzella is extensibility. The algorithms responsible for the actual music generation are distributed in a from of plugins. This allows the creators of the aforesaid music generating software to modify Salzella capabilities to their own liking. To prove that Salzella interpreter can indeed be used as internal engine of music generating tools, a prototype of an algorithm for converting musical pieces into Salzella programs was created. As a side effect of creation of this algorithm, three Salzella extensions were created. These extensions are responsible for: generating a melody, generating a simple harmony and generating a percussive complement. An algorithm for harmony analysis was also created as part of this thesis. This algorithm is used by the conversion algorithm. A development environment which allows its users to easily create and execute Salzella programs was also created as part of this thesis.This bachelor project is concerned with modification of an existing desktop application for exploded views of 3D models into a client-server web application.

But by the time this thesis is written,
generative music is coming more and more to the fore. Mainly because generating music is a much
more complex topic than only rules for music generation. It is also techniques for analysing music
and music structure description.
Algorithms for music analysis are quite developed. E.g. internet radio Pandora or Spotify benefits
of music analysis. These web pages allow the users to create their own personalized radio. This
radio play music based on user preferences. It is able to learn adjust itself for personal taste of its
listener.
To be able to do that, understanding of which songs are similar is needed. From my personal
experience the speed and accuracy of guessing is amazing.
These algorithms are quite developed, but what is the situation of real generating of music ?
Right now, there are the first attempts to use generative music e.g. for background music in
computer games. But generative music is still in phase of becoming a common part of our lives, it
is literally trying to find it is own purpose.
This is the reason I chose this topic. I'm interested in the techniques of generation of music,
especially how from given input get structure, which can be considered as music. In this thesis I'm
going to probe common ways of music generation and I'm going to describe my own approach to
generative music.This bachelor thesis discus about process of developing application for support in teaching of biology for tablets with Android operating system.

The most common way to represent them is via a class hierarchy which unfortunately introduces many problems such as the difficulty of hierarchy modification or a non-reusable code. This thesis focuses on a modern component-based game objects representation, which is a proper replacement for the class hierarchy. The component-based approach is very user friendly and does not suffer from problems the class hierarchy does. In the thesis a robust game object management system, which uses dividing a code to components and entity systems, was designed. This designed system was implemented as a set of library classes. Its usability was verified by specialization of the generic library to a library for 2D computer games and implementation of two separate games. The text can be used as a complete introduction to a virtual objects representation. The thesis proves the advantages of the component-based approaches over the class hierarchy and shows these advantages in practice by implementing two games. It is demonstrated that the components are easily reusable and that they can be managed with constant complexity thus the presented approach is suitable for real-time applications. The work deals with enabling the XMOS XK-1A microcontroller to be able to connect to a web camera through USB, in order to download a still picture from the camera and process the image data to recognize numbers in the picture.The task of this work is to analyze possible ways to illustrate the function of the system, which

Several approaches of how to do simulation of crowds have been made over the last decades.

The goal of this thesis is to create a model that controls the movement of agents in virtual space. Such model should be capable of simulating some common behaviors that are known from real evacuations. Using the methodological approaches described by authors of related articles a model was designed. This model is capable of navigation of agents in nontrivial and dangerous environment. After the analysis of available applications a list of requirements for a crowd simulation engine was designed. An application that implements a subset of these requirements was made. Functionality of the application and correctness of the designed model were proven by test, where several scenes that differ in crowd pressure were used.The thesis deals with the problem of illegal drug interdiction in the Caribbean Sea and East Pacific. The U.S. naval forces have employed the Battlespace on Demand (BonD) concept to aid them in warfighting effectiveness. The BonD concept introduces tier-based architecture which allows transformation of data in lower tiers into informed decisions in higher tier. The concept is flexible and can be employed in any domain where decision-making takes place.

In this work we present a way to use the BonD concept in the maritime drug interdiction domain. We design and implement software architecture reflecting the BonD concept and use it to make informed decisions based on data collected from the domain. We introduce algorithms optimizing asset allocation and evaluate them on the scenarios extracted from the domain.Mind maps represent a new revolutionary way of viewing, learning and discovering new
information, but suﬀer in reuseability. However ontologies are more conservative and the
formalized information capture approach makes them highly reuseable. This thesis discusses

advantages of both of these diﬀerent approaches. The methodology of creating reuseable
mind maps in ontology driven mind mapping tool Ontomind is presented together with
the improvements of the tool to further enhance the user experience. The implemented
features are then tested and the methodology is demonstrated on a chosen speciﬁc domain
to present that the two fundamentally diﬀerent approaches of information capture can be
brought together to beneﬁt one another.This work is focused on schedul-

This technique produces one of the most realistic imagines of synthetic scenes. As the computing power of modern CPUs is growing every year, it's possible to synthesize scenes several times faster than it was possible in the past. This makes the global illumination methods more and more popular for synthesis both static and dynamic scenes. It leads to need of creation a library, which would be usefull for the ray casting procedure. Such library should have very simple API for ray casting and obtaining information about ray hits. Naive approach of generating an imagine of synthetic scene by casting rays is very computationally demanding as we need to cast ray through every pixel in an image plane and test intersection of this ray with all scene triangles. This approach is more less inapplicable for scene even with tens or hundreds of triangles. This leads us to the second requirement. Such library should use some acceleration structure, which speeds up the ray casting procedure to nearly real time computation.
Goal of my thesis is to design and implement such library. The main emphasis was placed on simplicity of API, multithreading, usage of single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions and bounding volume hierarchy as acceleration structure, which is one of the most popular accelerating structure used for ray casting. The library should also be easily extendable with more acceleration data structures. The library can also be useful for learning and teaching purposes.
The first part of the thesis deals with a theoretical introduction to the problem of image synthesis using global illumination methods, namely the ray tracing method and path tracing. In this part the algorithms and acceleration structures are described in detail.
The second part of the thesis discusses the implementation of the library and the measurement results on both static and dynamic scenes.This Bachelor's thesis is concerned with design and implementation of a mobile application that can plan cycle journeys in Prague.

After introducing CAVE in 1992 university teams from all over the world form their own CAVE. Czech Technical University is not an exception, its CAVE can be found at Faculty of Electrical Engineering at Institute of Intermedia. Unfortunately expanding of its usage is discouraged by software used for collecting input data, trackd. This paper describes disadvantages of current state, explores various input devices suitable for using in CAVE, analyses approaches of other frameworks and as a solution suggests a new program, which can correspondingly replace trackd and cooperate with existing graphical applications. Furthermore it also allows extensions for possible future needs of CAVE, such as options of writing new inputs and outputs. This way CAVE is no longer limited by its input and can further evolve.

Indirect illumination is a very important component of realistic image synthesis. It captures subtle interreflection effects, such as color bleeding, that give us important clues about the scene.  It is also the most computationally expensive part of the whole process. One of the method for computing global illumination is Instant Radiosity. It uses Monte Carlo integration and creates virtual light sources in the scene to substitute contribution from indirect light bounces. In scenes with high geometry and light complexity, the number of virtual lights required to avoid noticeable error can be too large to use each of them for each pixel, making some subsampling scheme necessary.

This thesis extends the previous work on such schemes to accommodate dynamic scenes. It implements Importance Caching - a robust algorithm that combines spatial indirect illumination caching and importance sampling and provides means to capture small and sudden changes in illumination where other methods fail. It is further improved to exploit temporal coherence as well as spatial one in dynamic scenes by extending the rendering with cache updating step borrowed and customized from an algorithm called Instant Caching, where the cached information is verified with respect to the current state of the scene and updated appropriately. To evaluate this, we implemented a prototype rendering system that supports dynamic scenes. The results show how dynamic importance caching in complex scenes compares to naive virtual lights sampling and Instant Caching.Computing a photo realistic image of an arbitrary virtual scene in an affordable amount of
time is still an open problem. Often, one has to trade certain illumination effects for speed.
However, the recently proposed global illumination methods show that the solution to the
problem does not only lie in increasing the speed of the computer hardware, but also in
careful algorithm design.
This thesis presents a comprehensive overview of the theory of the global illumination,
discusses the fundamental rendering algorithms using the presented concepts and a recent
method, vertex connection and merging (VCM), is presented in detail as a combination
of the basic algorithms. The text follows with the description of the architecture
of an advanced photorealistic rendering software and with the description of the VCM implementation
within an existing rendering toolkit. Then we evaluate the VCM algorithm,
compare it to the other algorithms, and present how its input parameters affect the resulting
image.SketchUp is a program for creating 3D models. Its greatest advantages are ease of use, own database of models (3D Warehouse) and link with Google Earth.

Although some implementations contain a default logic to work with the resources that are mapped to objects in the application model, but the definition of resources is explicitly required for each single resource. Any differences in the default implementation of the processing of resources are necessary to be put directly into the code. Both of these problems can ruin the programmer's life.

An alternative solution could thus generate resources automatically, if the dependence between resources and objects of the application's domain will be found, respectively application's model that represents this domain. A universal logic for processing requests, which, however, will be able to respond to the different requirements of resources, could solve the aforementioned problems and to simplify the programmer's work.This thesis deals with the problem of under-explored space of mid-air text input techniques,

The most common way to represent them is via a class hierarchy which unfortunately introduces many problems such as the difficulty of hierarchy modification or a non-reusable code.
This thesis focuses on a modern component-based game objects representation, which is a proper replacement for the class hierarchy. The component-based approach is very user friendly and does not suffer from problems the class hierarchy does. In the thesis a robust game object management system, which uses dividing a code to components and entity systems, was designed.
This designed system was implemented as a set of library classes. Its usability was verified by specialization of the generic library to a library for 2D computer games and implementation of two separate games. The text can be used as a complete introduction to a virtual objects representation.
The thesis proves the advantages of the component-based approaches over the class hierarchy and shows these advantages in practice by implementing two games. It is demonstrated that the components are easily reusable and that they can be managed with constant complexity thus the presented approach is suitable for real-time applications.

This bachelor thesis deals with a creation of web component using the Adobe Flash in a programming language ActionScript3. The Goal of this thesis is the component presenting and editing video on web pages. It’s possible to create and share annotations of videos. The component enables simple video editing, but component only creates prescription for external application. It’s written about general problem, then analysis, design, implementation and testing of application. Application provides space for people to express themselves. The goal of this thesis is to propose a way how to recognize and recover relations between
data entities and also relations between graphical user interface elements and data entities
in a modern enterprise information system and do it through a semi-automated process.
This area is not too much researched, although the needs for a large enterprise system
comprehension grow stronger, because current information systems are typically built in
a time pressure, the requirements change often during the implementation and thus the
documentation is often not up-to-date. This is why the maintainability of such systems is
low and future upgrades or improvements are hard to be implemented. It is obvious that an
utility that can help in comprehension of the system behavior is welcome. The reconstruction
of the above mentioned relationships can significantly improve the maintainability of the
particular information system.
The theoretical part of this thesis describes (i) the architecture of enterprise information
systems, i.e. information systems based on J2EE application servers, (ii) techniques of testing
web based applications and (iii) state-of-the-art knowledge on reverse engineering. The
following part proposes a novel technique of database log analysis that makes possible to find
relationships between GUI actions and database state changes. The proposed method was
verified on a real information system developed recently by the Department of Cybernetics
team within the Netcarity project. The final part is focused on evaluation of the achieved
results.The thesis focuses on web-based user interface of a specific information system.

and their description for VRML scene creators, extends default functional-
ity of SceneJS with new interactive nodes for users who are unfamiliar with
VRML.This thesis focuses on the problem of navigation of visually impaired people, especially in urban areas. The main objective of this thesis is to provide help to visually impaired people in situations when they lose orientation and to reduce their dependence on passers-by. To this purpose, an extensive qualitative research was carried out. The research focuses on the general problem of navigation of visually impaired people in urban areas, as well as on situations when the visually impaired lose orientation and thus become dependent on other people's help. The outcome of this research was a series of hypotheses that were subsequently verified in a quantitative ethnographic field study. On the basis of the knowledge gathered in this study a concept of an automatic assistance center based on the principle of mutual cooperation among visually impaired people was proposed. The center would also offer to visually impaired people a new form of help in situations when they lose orientation.Thesis describes analysis, design and implementation of simple tool for 2D annotation of architectural elements.

However, this comes at a price as clients need to transmit significantly more data. Average size of today's web pages is rising so fast that it actually surpasses the increase in internet connection speeds. This results in slower page load times. Longer wait for page load discourages the visitors resulting in loss of potential customers.

The goal of this thesis is improving the current method for distributing content on the web by introducing a distributed cache. The basic idea is sharing static content from the visited web pages between their visitors. By providing a small amount of their resources visitors help spread the static content distributed by web servers. In comparison to the current model of obtaining the content  needed to render a page, this innovative approach brings excellent scalability because the number of content providers increases along with the number of clients requesting the content.This diploma thesis deals with design of an algorithm for the human resource scheduling.

This problem arises when an original roster is disrupted by some absence of a nurse at the rostering period and the original roster becomes unfeasible. Then, it is necessary to make changes at the roster to make it feasible again. However, the new modified roster should be as similar to original one as possible. Finding an optimal solution of this problem is very time consuming operation since it is NP-hard. The objective of this thesis is to design and implement the parallel algorithm solving NRRP on a Graphical Processing Unit. A significant speedup is achieved in comparsion to a sequential version of the algorithm. Indirect illumination is the fundamental part of realistic image synthesis. Its evaluation is computationally expansive and usually highly dependent on geometrical complexity of the scene.

Contemporary enterprise systems introduce multiple challenges for software engineers and developers. Multiple approaches exist to deal with business rules such as validation, contextual or cross-cutting rule, tangled with security policies, etc. Unfortunately, standard technological approaches are complex, fail to effectively represent system knowledge and introduce knowledge restatement. In consequence, developers are forced to use custom and non-standardized approach that covers the business rules, but usually leads to information restatement, code tangling and hard to maintain solutions.

This thesis introduces an alternative concept based on an independent efficient knowledge declaration through a domain specific language (DSL). Business information is captured in DSL and can be transformed into a context and this can be accessible to all application layers, while not introduction any kind of information restatement. As the result, it opens the way to design applications adaptable to user's context. Furthermore, this thesis presents a proof-of-concept study that demonstrates reduction of information restatement, amount of code, error proneness and significantly increases application maintainability.Aim of my work was ready software development environment very platform independent.

Program for shape change as first learns original shading from input picture, then made geometric modifications and in the end the shade modified parts. By method described in this thesis is possible to perform deformations responding to original surface which in result creates effect of homogeneous scene. Shading of new geometric parts works best on scenes lit by directional lights when is used simple shade material which contains only diffuse component. Good results were also achieved on more complex scenes. Quality of results primary depends on quality of depth map eventually normal map. The scope of this master thesis is to study predictive image synthesis. Predictive image synthesis is a part of photo-realistic rendering, which is based on using physically exact algorithms for computing global illumination. The prediction of the final images is based on a real world model, thus the results can be objectively evaluated.
 The aim of this work was to extend the previously created 3D model of the MPII building, which consisted of building geometry, approximated materials and measured light characteristics. This static model of the MPII building was parameterized, allowing the following dynamic modifications of the model: i) geometry modifications of movable elements such as doors, windows or window shutters, ii) controlling the lights in the building, iii) modifying the cameras in the virtual scene. Further, a user interface was implemented, which allowed model animations and generation of input data for a physically based rendering algorithm.
 The correctness of the implemented parametric model of the MPII building was verified by creating five reference video sequences of the animated model.

One of them is the frequent occurrence of erroneous models. This thesis is concerned with errors in models in boundary representation with special emphasis on their detection. A method has been designed which searches and accurately localizes a wide range of error types and assumes their repair by local manipulations directly in initial boundary representation on the model. It is suitable for hand-made models, where should be preserved as much details as possible. With regard to complexity of the method and a possible mutual interconnection of the errors, the procedure of detection and repair is divided into 17 phases, while only a few error types are treated in every phase. The whole method is finally tested on a series of real and synthetic models.This thesis deals with content management systems.

they provide us with the information about relative position of objects and their
size in three dimensional space. Therefore they are indespensable in rendering
realistic images in computer graphics. Precise computation of the shadows in real
time is, however, a very expensive operation. In order to compensate for this,
several alternative approaches were developed at cost of certain reduction of
visual quality.

Among these approaches, the probably most frequently used method is called shadow
mapping. However, its speed and simplicity is paid back by several drawbacks.
Probably the most significant one is dependency on limited image resolution of
graphic cards which causes discretization errors. These errors lead to inaccurate
rendering of the shadow boundaries which is known as aliasing. This paper
presents an algorithm which uses the original shadow mapping method, and by
utilizing the capabilities of modern graphic cards removes the limiting
dependency and renders correct shadows in any resolution.The aim of the thesis is to evaluate the Silverlight platform in terms of programming, content creation and compare it with other similar platforms in the market.

In today’s computer games, a well-developed story is one of the reasons people buy and play them. There are multiple ways of narrating the story - the storytelling can be put directly into the game moments, there can be in-game sequences revealing the plot, or there can be a pre-rendered movies called Full Motion Video (FMV), which are the subject of this work.
We describe there the whole process of producing an FMV, from the design process (idea generation, writing the script, character and world design, storyboarding) to the technical part (modeling, skinning, animation, rendering); we also add observations about editing (assigning sound to the rendered video, cutting the final video). As there is always more than one way to achieve the required result, we also compare different techniques concerning modeling, rendering and animation in context of creating an appropriate video for a game.
As this work was developed together with creation of two FMV sequences for Project Genesis game, it is possible to see a direct application of most methods described (see the content of the enclosed DVD).
This integrated view on the FMV sequences is, for the time being, very rare - there are many books about game character development or storytelling for games, as well as tutorials covering the subject of modeling and animation; but these are only fragments of the whole production procedure. That is why we would like to offer a study of the complete process, so that anybody interested in the topic can find out how the design process look like and what the individual phases of creation are.The main purpose of this work was to prepare and implement a system that combines two

This thesis examines the effectivity of different implementations of acceleration structure modularity in a C++ ray tracer. We split the acceleration structure into 3 parts: data storage, build, and intersection. These parts have to be linked together in a way that allows easy change of any of them. We have implemented this by two instruments: by object-oriented programming (virtual calls) and by generic programming (templates).
After that, we made several configurations combining both approaches, and tested their performance on six standardised scenes. These tests were made for both implemented acceleration structures: uniform grid and BVH.  We showed that the performance impact of virtual calls is non-negligible and, therefore, we should carefully consider using them if there exist workarounds.This bachelor\\\'s thesis is dealing partly with the design and mostly with implementation of a web system for project management in organizations.

terns capable of failure prevention, detection, and recovery. One of those design patterns is
tested and evaluated in CAMNEP system.
People suffering from dementia, cognitive dysfunctions, memory, time and space orientation dysfunctions, are in most cases condemned to life under non-stopping supervision of family members or other caretakers. These dysfunctions are mostly caused by the Alzheimer decease and number of patients suffering from it rises continually. In today’s time of smartphones with advanced operating systems and very wide functionality, it is impossible for these people to learn how to correctly and efficiently use these phones. The main aim was to design GUI that is user friendly	 and simple to use by patients suffering from dysfunctions of cognitive brain functions. Furthermore, the goal of this project was to design and implement a web application for remote maintenance of contact and reminder databasase of the GUI. The application was tested on a selected group of people with age over 75 years and a selected group of people aging from 20 years to 30 years.
Beside basic cell phone functions (phone calls, short message system) a reminders system was implemented. The Reminder system alerts the user every day at the same time to use his medicaments or of any other user-defined event. GUI design was to be simple and intuitive. Contact list was designed to work based on a picture of contacts rather than names in text form. For enhanced functionality, a web application for remote maintenance of contact and reminder databases was designed. This application serves for synchronization between GUI’s and web databases over the HTTP protocol, after successful login of a caretaker.

testingThe mutual exclusion (mutex) state invariants are defined in a context of STRIPS planning as sets of facts from which maximally one can be true in any state reachable from the initial state. In this work, we introduce two new types of mutex invariants along with a detailed description of their structure and their relation to a general mutex invariant. Moreover, we provide a complexity analysis of decision problems that correspond to inference of different types of mutex invariants. Finally, three novel algorithms for inference of mutex invariants are described and experimentally compared with two different state-of-the-art algorithms.This thesis formalizes the Stackelberg extensive form correlated equilibrium (SEFCE) with multiple followers for extensive games with perfect recall. In this scenario, the leader commits to a strategy that is observed by the followers that play a best response. Moreover, he is able to coordinate the course of the game through a series of moves recommended to the players. Each move is revealed to a follower when he reaches the information set where he can take that move. The thesis shows that in multi-player extensive games with perfect recall, the linear program describing SEFCE has polynomial number of constraints, but number of variables is exponential. Moreover, it proves that unless P = NP, the equilibrium can never be found  in polynomial time in games with more than three players, or if the game contains chance nodes. The algorithm computing SEFCE was implemented and evaluated on randomly generated games. The experimental results show that the computation time grows exponentially in a size of a game tree.The main aim of this bachelor thesis is design of suitable protocol to discuss on the internet.

Another target is to identify the    parameters which have influence on the process. After that the final task is to make the user study. This problematic is large and it is not easy to describe the definitive solution. However, I have used for the work an article that was given to me and also some algorithms, for       example modified algorithm for searching a way and MFCC. The created solution provides prolongation or shortening music on size which are required. The suitable setting is found from the result of the user study.   This thesis describes implementation of an application for scene text recognition. That is a more complex task than text recognition in printed documents. The application is designed for mobile phones, thus allocation of resources is taken into special consideration.
   
   Possible use of such application is assitence for visualy impaired, or machine translation of the recognized text.
   
   At first, the algorithm for extracting text from image is described. This approach is implemented as a library that processes its tasks in parallel. On top of it an Android application is built.
   
   The conclusion is, the application is not 100 % successful, which is determined by the task's complexity. The result is compared to existing state-of-the-art applications for mobile phone scene text recognition.These days delivery companies try to deliver a consignment to a customer as soon as
possible. They focus especially on a same day delivery and immediate delivery service,
therefore dynamic vehicle problem (D-VRP) begins to be a part of logistics planning systems.

This thesis presents the existing variants of D-VRP including solution methods. The
variant studied by this work involves heterogeneous fleet, limited capacity, time windows,
arbitrary pickup and delivery location without a necessity of visiting depot in a dynamic
environment. The dynamic environment is defined by time dependent traffic model and
consignment's generation in the real time.

The problem is formalized as an optimization task. A multi-agent system including
planning algorithm was designed as a solution to assign new consignments to couriers.

The proposed model is transformed into a multi-agent simulation and evaluated on the
real data. The evaluation results show that the multi-agent system is able to serve to human
dispatchers as the real support system. The measured rate of reasonable assignment of
consignment is up to 96%.The aim of the thesis is to create a prototype of system that allows creating and

The main part of this thesis describes ENDF format, which is specifically used for numerical simulations of fusion plasma. This format is described in-depth. There is explained how it calculates specific values of cross-sections from these data, too. Natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDB) are systems that are able to translate natural language queries supplied by users into formal database queries in order to retrieve the requested information from a database.

This thesis explores the possibility to use the RESTful Web services as the underlying knowledge base for a NLIDB system instead of prevalent relational databases.
It follows the design and implementation of NaLIDa, a NLIDB that provides an interface to the university information system via intermediate RESTful API service called KOSapi.

The system annotates the natural language input with the help of Standford CoreNLP toolkit and uses the annotations to generate and filter semantic interpretation hypotheses. After a disambiguation, the interpretation is mapped to entities in a graph representation of the underlying database and the shortest path search algorithm finds an optimal join path connecting these entities. In the end, the path is transformed into a sequence of requests to the API.

The experiments performed on the data collected from members of the target audience show that for the valid inputs, the systems exhibits
precision 96.8 %, recall 85.9 %, willingness 88.7 % and average response time 1.6 s. These results are considered satisfactory in the comparison with those reported by other systems, but the experiments also revealed opportunities for prospective accuracy improvements and extensions of the valid input range.This bachelor thesis is concerned with the creation of biofeedback games for therapy purposes.

First, the thesis includes a broad overview of the related literature. Then, we present an innovative hierarchical problem which allows modelling of many optimisation problems that combine planning and scheduling. The problem consists of an objective function, a set of projects and a set of resources, where both of them are grouped into hierarchical structures. The goal is to find an assignment of multiple projects to available resources such that a value of the objective function is minimised. Next, we propose a new heuristic algorithm for the considered problem. Then, the whole algorithm with its two layers, called the higher level and the lower level, and the respective communication between is described in depth. Finally, the extensive computational experiments performed with our implementation of the algorithm in C# programming language shown that the algorithm can efficiently solve very large problem instances.This thesis describes the development of the Scenario designer: a software tool developed within the European project ARUM. 

The tool aims to provide a graphical user interface that allows its user to set up, visualize and monitor ramp-up productions.
The thesis contains the functional requirements analysis, architecture, design and the partial implementation of the Scenario designer(SD) graphical interface. The SD has been developed as a part of the Factory network\Scenario designer tool (FNSD).Effort was made to follow user-centered design processes during the development of both tools and a sub-set of the FNSD interface design was tested with end users. The obtained feedback resulted in the design adjustment according to the user's needs and preferences.

The result of this work is the design of a managerial tool to support ramp-up productions, developed according to gathered requirements from earlier ARUM project phases.This work deals with scheduling of tasks on heterogeneous computational resources. Users send their tasks to the system continuously (online) and the goal of the scheduling algorithm is to allocate each task on some available computational resource. As soon as the task is processed by the computational resource, the result of the task is sent back to the corresponding user. It's important for the user that the solution of the task is received as fast as possible (the duration between sending the task to the system and receiving the solution by the user is called response time).  Tasks are solved by anytime algorithms. The characteristic of these algorithms is that they can be stopped at any time. The quality of solutions found by the anytime algorithms is determined from the running time of the algorithm - the longer the algorithm is running, the better solution may be found. The anytime property is used for solving the system overload problem, which arises when the capacity of the computational resources is not enough.  In case of an overload the response time may increase dramatically, which would lead to dissatisfaction of the users. By controlling the requested quality of the solutions, the running time of the algorithms can be decreased in case of an overload and thus maintaining the response time on an acceptable level.  For scheduling of tasks and controlling the quality of solutions, we proposed a simple heuristic, which operates in two steps. The first step is responsible for allocation of the tasks on the resources and the second step controls the requested quality of the solutions, so that the response time is maintained on an acceptable level.  The work also deals with estimating the progress of the solution quality for the given running time of the algorithm. Knowledge of the progress is important for the scheduling algorithm.Nowadays, the number of applications in complex systems increases rapidly and some of them have real-time requirements, while others do not. These applications share resources, such as memories, processors or interconnect, in order to reduce cost and power consumption of the systems. However, sharing causes contention between sharing applications, which must be resolved by a resource arbiter. This master thesis uses Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) for these purposes. TDM employs a table of a fixed length with slots allocated to the applications. Although it is a commonly used arbiter, it is a difficult problem to find a TDM frame size and slot assignment that satisfy the bandwidth and latency requirements of the real-time applications that use the resource. Moreover, it is important to minimize the resource utilization of these applications to provide non-real-time clients with better performance.
This master thesis considers the described problem and proposes an efficient methodology to solve it. The five main contributions are: 1) An optimal integer linear programming (ILP) model, assuming a given frame size is proposed; 2) An optimal branch-and-price approach for a given frame size is presented; 3) Two filtering heuristics for choosing a limited set of frame sizes for the models, mentioned above, are presented. The optimal frame size for this and the next model is found by iterating over all frame sizes in a given interval; 4) An optimal ILP model, synthesizing the frame size is presented; 5) The four approaches have been implemented and experimentally evaluated. From our experiments, we conclude that the first ILP model significantly outperforms the other optimal approaches in terms of computation time and that the heuristics provide solid reduction of computation time, sacrificing only less than 3% of the resource utilization on average.The evolution of the software is the problem that software developers have to face.

Then, a chosen implementation of the algorithm, executed experiments and obtained results are presented.Distributed planning and scheduling plays a major role in many industrial applications ranging from multirobotics systems, military tactical operations to manufacturing and logistics. In this master thesis, we present and describe a multi-agent solver which uses techniques of task sharing, delegation and allocation on locally planned resources. The agent-based task and resource allocation tool, which we have implemented, is called TARF-tool. Using various planning algorithms based on first-in first-out (FIFO) fashion, last-in first-out (LIFO) fashion or heuristics, this tool is capable of solving both scheduling and transportational problems.

Using the TARF-tool's graphical user interface (GUI), you can specify tasks, which you want to schedule, available agents and resources, objective function to be optimized, run the TARF-tool solver and thus obtain an optimized schedule. In the last part of the thesis, two allocation scenarios demonstrate the features and functionality of the TARF-tool. Also presented there, the stress test results tell us, how the computation time of planners changes with increasing number of tasks.The thesis daels with a design of subsystem and its implementation making possible for

A potential breakthrough in this race could be made by anticipating the adversary’s next move. We attempted to achieve it by devising a procedure, which serves for designing optimal attacks against a particular network detector based on anomaly detection. The proposed method is tested against exact optimal values, and verified to efficiently produce maximal attacks on the mentioned detector. Our findings are important for the evaluation of the security of the analysed detection system and can be used for its improvement.Client-side web form data validation has big impact on web applications 
and ideally every project that processes user input for predefined
purposes should use this type of value checking. It is mostly beneficial for
user interaction with page, but also network traffic is kept at necessary minimum
and application servers are not burdened by processing invalid data. For this purpose
a simple yet sufficient JavaScript library is introduced. Universal transformation 
framework AspectFaces strives for such type of validation and the library
is integrated into AspectFaces-based project as a result of this work.The goal of this thesis was to develop an algorithm that schedules tasks of planned
projects in the company to its employees. Emphasis is placed on the optimality of the
assignment of workers to the tasks of the projects according to their skills and experience
so that the projects meet their deadlines.
The work includes design, implementation and test cases of the algorithm based on a
generic branch and bound algorithm that tries to meet this target. The designed algorithm
uses two optimization criteria. The first of them is the optimization criterion of
the assignment that optimizes the schedule according to the input information including
capabilities of the workers on specific job types. The second optimization criterion
restricts the projects’ finish times in order to speed up their completion and therefore
minimize the risk of exceeding the projects’ deadlines.
The second part of this work is the design and implementation of a simple application

application using a Gantt diagram implemented as a JSF component. The application
also provides the ability to modify the list of workers and to quantify the degree of
experience and efficiency in various areas of their work which is then used by the
scheduling library.
The scheduling algorithm output can be displayed as a set of schedules, each for an
individual employee.The goal of this work is to present the existing solutions for remote management of MikroTik devices via graphical interface (GUI). The main goal is to develop a better application which is able to detect and present in GUI the network topology.

in the way of data preprocessing, feature selection, the role of prior knowledge in the in-
tegration and learning method. Finally, the best settings and the optimal workflow were
recommended.
The task of filtering email spam (also known as Unsolicited Bulk Mail) has been an important topic in the machine learning community during the last two decades. Although the existing techniques are able to filter the majority of spam, more sophisticated spammers are constantly refining their strategy so that their messages pass the existing filters. One example of such behaviour is a new spamming trend observed by the largest freemail service provider in the Czech Republic. The unsolicited bulk mail which resembles a standard newsletter is delivered to the email addresses, which come from illegally obtained databases. We use a term Illegal newsletters for such behavior. The problem of such emails is that we cannot use the content filters to detect them and that the senders mask themselves by changing IP addresses and domains. Currently the contracting email service provider is manually gathering information about the senders of Illegal newsletters, so it can develop defence algorithms. Because manual analysis is highly inefficient, we propose a system which should help human operators in identifying new spammers by highlighting suspicious emails. We propose features that should describe normal behavior of the senders and we use anomaly detection algorithms to detect abnormal emails. The preliminary results from testing on small set  of labeled emails suggests that the majority of anomaly emails represents unsolicited bulk mails and that such approach should help the operators in identifying a significant portion of delivered spam.In this thesis we explore specific bottom-up learning procedures for classifying data in the form of relational structures. The key idea is to find a discriminative set of a few specific structures, which are homomorphic to as many positive examples and as few negative examples as possible. Our learning approach is based on finding Plotkin's least general generalization which we reformulated in terms of relational structures. The least general generalization is used in specific bounded versions exploiting local consistency techniques from the constraint satisfaction programming. We also provide an equivalent formulation of our approach in terms of the first order logic.Enterprise software systems, managing large numbers of computers and allowing numerous
people to cooperate, can grow to unmanageable scales. Maintenance and extension
of such systems constructed as single software monoliths gets complex and resources
needed to work with such systems grow in a significantly superlinear fashion. In order
to make those systems simpler, developers can adopt the Service oriented architecture
(SOA) approach, where systems are divided into multiple separate subsystems, services,
whose purpose it is to respectively manage a single function of the system.
This thesis describes the implementation of three components for the ARUM (Adaptive
Production Management) project, which is based on Enterprise service bus (ESB)
implementation of SOA. The ARUM project creates a highly sophisticated software
system, that will be capable of managing human and material resources, planning,
scheduling and supervising the manufacture of a commercial jet airliner.
These three components consist of firstly a deployment tool, used by administrators
to effectively deploy and undeploy components to the ESB, secondly a Jade gateway
library, allowing Jade platform agents to communicate with ESB services and vice versa
and thirdly a database service that encapsulates multiple database engines and types
and unifies the access through a common protocol and provides encapsulated databases
as a service.This thesis concerns the problem of strongly constrained course timetabling with imperfect time-dependent information taken into account. The aim of this thesis is to design and implement an effective incremental activity scheduling algorithm which would solve this problem. 

After reviewing the state of the art, a novel meta-algorithm is proposed, which encapsulates an inner search algorithm.

Not only desktop computers are used for browsing websites, use of mobile devices is growing rapidly. These devices have above all different screen sizes and different ways of operating (mostly by touch screens). This increases the requirements for creating web pages, thereby increasing costs for development and maintenance. The web provides and manipulates user data. The data validation depends on their types. Modern web pages validate data in an user interface. Validation rules depend on model’s classes, so each of their change leads to modification of user interfaces. Such modifications are expensive and liable to mistakes.
Goal of this work is to show a way how to significantly reduce the costs of maintaining of user interfaces. Automatic generation of validation from the model class is a new and completely different way of creating of the user interface. Possible ways of costs reduction on the development will be shown, together with nowadays options for maintenance of modern web applications for various devices.This thesis is about ﬁnding the capabilities of WANic 56512 which is a network card with a packet processor.

Following work formalizes problem of inspector scheduling in public transport networks. This problem touches current issues of crew scheduling in railway and especially subway networks and is supposed to lower potential loss in profit caused by fare evading portion
of passenger population. We focus on offline pre-computation and prediction of admissible daily schedules.

Firstly, the problem is formalized from mathematical point of view as a constrained optimization problem. Attention is paid to well defined optimization criterion based on expected value of checked passenger which is used to evaluate generated schedules. Also time and location constraints for inspector movement must have been taken into account, so that the result could best meet the reality. Some space is also left for customization of individual capabilities of inspectors.

Solution is then proposed in the form of several state-space search algorithms backed in easily usable scheduling toolbox. The approaches differ in various level of inspector cooperation that is considered, optimality, completeness and thread-based boost-up that is used. The implementation is focused on good object-oriented design with stress on extensibility and generality while being able to solve the hard problem.

Finally, we present results for several experiments. The experiments are either standalone tests or simulation runs on AgentPolis platform and are supposed to cover standard performance characteristics such as: time, memory and schedule quality. Simulation, on the other hand, reveals comparison to different passenger strategies.This thesis deals with the school project Collaboration with industry, designed as a portal solution built on the Liferay platform.

The paper theoretically describes the algorithms for trajectory planning implemented in the AgentFly system. The first of the algorithms, AA*, uses an adaptive size of the sampling step, allowing dynamic discretization of the searched space. The second algorithm, Hexgrid, is based on planning upon a hexagonal discretization grid. Next follows the description and comparison by a set of criteria of selected systems used for creating FDMs, namely ROS, JSBSim, Matlab and YASim. The criteria include the ease of use, realism of the created model, the state of documentation and kinds of operating systems on which the systems work. Afterwards an interface between the flight simulation and the trajectory planner of AgentFly is designed and implemented. Part of this interface is the planner of maneuvers for flight along the trajectory. One of the mentioned systems is used for a check of the interface implementation. The purpose of this check is to ascertain the correctness and faultlessness of data exchange between AgentFly and the FDM. The implemented interface is afterwards used for the purpose of comparison of flights following a given plan using a real quadcopter and a simulated one. There were some deviations from the plan detected in the simulation, caused by too conservative and rigid maneuvers issued by the interface. The behaviour of the simulation can be improved by a broader set of maneuvers and better control regulators.This work deals with refactoring and connecting various parts of the existing system E-Volby.

Their research aims for many objectives with learning algorithms being the crucial direction. Learning ANNs corresponds to optimization of their internal parameters or even structure. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are general optimization methods inspired in Nature known for ability to solve complex problems. The combination of both ANNs and EAs, often called neuro-evolution, has already produced a large number of algorithms with many successful applications. An obvious deficiency of current neuro-evolution approaches lies in a fact that they are even remotely unable to evolve artificial brains matching their real counterparts. The human brain consist of almost 100 billion neurons while each is connected to as many as 7,000 others. Interestingly, such highly complicated structure is, along with rest of the body, described by a genome having between 20,000 to 25,000 genes. This immense compression ratio is only facilitated by high regularity which can be observed at all scales of magnification in living organisms. The described encoding scheme is quite unlike in classic neuro-evolutionary approach called the direct encoding where the number of genes corresponds to the number of ANN's structural parts (neurons, connections). Methods based on the direct encoding are unable to evolve the large-scale neural networks as mentioned above which is given by the extreme dimension of the optimization problem to be solved. However, there is currently an extensive research on the so-called indirect encodings mimicking the Nature's way in order to make large-scale ANNs possible. This thesis deals with one such state-of-the-art indirect approach known as Hypercube-based encoding. Rather than on the encoding itself we are focused on efficient base algorithms, i.e., the EAs which employ the encoding. The motivation lies in a fact that the simulation of the large-scale ANNs is highly computationally demanding, therefore our aim is to significantly reduce the number of fitness function evaluations. In this work, we propose two novel effective algorithms called Genetic Programming with Explicit Fitness Sharing (GPEFS) and Genetic Programming of Augmenting Topologies (GPAT). We compare our two methods to the well-known approaches: Genetic Programming and NEAT showing a significant improvement. The use of the new algorithms is in no way limited to indirect encoding: they are generally usable as well as our novel distance measures for tree structures being their essential part. Besides the main objectives this work deals also with other ANN indirect encodings (Cellular and Edge Encodings) and with novel methods of diversity visualization for Evolutionary Algorithms.This bachelor thesis discusses about development of mobile applications for people with special cognitive needs and it is trying to find solutions for these applications to increase rate of accessibility for this target group on the basis of theoretical and practical knowledge in the area of special education, psychlogy and Information Technology.

I consider this an imperfect solution as the program suffers from programming errors, slow load times for certain scenes and it lacks intuitive controls. The aim of my project was to re-implement this application for mobile and tablet devices, which would make the controls more intuitive and allow children to practice important skills at home and with the help of their parents.
The project met all my expectations and was successfully tested by real users – visually impaired kids. The mobile and tablet application is faster, more reliable and has a superior graphical interface to the PC version.Many big companies have special departments dedicated to Business Intelligence, i.e.~ data processing aimed at supporting management decision making.

Existing open-source library LIBOCAS implements the OCA algorithm for two important instances of such problems, namely, the Support Vector Machines algorithms for training linear two-class classifiers (SVM) and for training linear multi-class classifiers (MSVM).  

In this thesis we implemented an extended version of the LIBOCAS library which is able to solve the risk minimization problems with a more generic risk function. In particular, our solver allows the risk to be a generic piece-wise linear function.  We give necessary mathematical background of the OCA algorithm and we describe details of our implementation. We show how to use our generic library to implement solvers for the SVM and the MSVM algorithms. We experimentally compare our implementation with the LIBOCAS on several benchmark data sets. The comparison shows that our library obtains exactly the same solution as the LIBOCAS requiring a comparable convergence time while being able to deal with far more generic risk functions.This Bachelor’s project is focused on studying of the COLLADA file format, used primarily to store complex 3d scenes (inluding geometry, materials, textures, light sources, cameras, animation etc.) and also on studying of possible tools intended to process and display the data from this format.

In our work we have first formalized the current problem of transportation by the taxis when
there are passengers billed same price without respect to the current supply and demand.
We think that the solution of this system should be following. Passengers who are willing
to pay more will travel first and passengers who do not mind waiting will pay less. We also
assume that this system will increase the average income to the taxi drivers.
Afterwards we suggest solution by the algorithm that uses several independently running
auctions where each of them belong to the taxi driver entity. We have also suggested several
algorithms that are helping us to simulate the human behavior which would be in real world
usage made by user or either can be transfered to the automatic system.
Then we have implemented the system that is based on the multi agent simulation plat-
form AgentPolis. The whole system was implemented with respect to good testability of the
critical parts and also with respect of the simulation platform where it can be used as an
integral part of the system.
As the last step we have made several experiments. We have made experiment where we
have simulated high number of taxis and passengers and also some smaller experiments from
which we have composed one big experiment. And as the last from the experiments we have
made was experiment where we have measured the performance of our implemented system.

The Visual Profiler features tracing and sampling profiling engines together with an innovative way of presenting the profiling results within the integrated development environment Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.Salzella is a domain specific declarative language. Its primary focus lies in the field of music generation. The key principle upon which the language is built can be summarized as follows: For any existing piece of music it should be possible to create a Salzella program which will describe it in a way that running this program will output a piece of music similar to the original. Salzella programs are presumed to be generated rather then written by hand. The sole purpose of Salzella is to make creation of music generating tools easier. Bundling Salzella interpreter with music generating software and using it as an engine can provide a significant level of abstraction and thus make the development of such software a lot easier. Tools built on top of Salzella can generate Salzella programs and let the interpreter worry about the actual music generation. The key structural property of Salzella is extensibility. The algorithms responsible for the actual music generation are distributed in a from of plugins. This allows the creators of the aforesaid music generating software to modify Salzella capabilities to their own liking. To prove that Salzella interpreter can indeed be used as internal engine of music generating tools, a prototype of an algorithm for converting musical pieces into Salzella programs was created. As a side effect of creation of this algorithm, three Salzella extensions were created. These extensions are responsible for: generating a melody, generating a simple harmony and generating a percussive complement. An algorithm for harmony analysis was also created as part of this thesis. This algorithm is used by the conversion algorithm. A development environment which allows its users to easily create and execute Salzella programs was also created as part of this thesis.This diploma thesis deals with design and implementation of voting device hardware for self-government autorities.

The objective of the bachelor project was to describe already existing methods of matching 3D models and create suitable matching metric for the case when models are represented by the form of octrees and voxel values move in the interval of &lt;0, 1&gt;.  
The asset of the thesis is creating suitable matching metric for the case when volume density of 3D models varies itself. The issue of different volume density of 3D models occurs widely e.g.in medicine, when a doctor gets e.g. a 2D view of the head and after that a 3D model of the head is reconstructed (restored) from 2D views. Then from the tomograph this model has different volume density in different places (e.g. free places, brain, rhexis, etc.). When we  compare 3D models which have different volume density, then it is a pivotal situation, since  comparing octrees will be more complicated due to their different depth.

The short length of the 48-bit secret key employed makes the cipher vulnerable to a brute-force attack, i.e., exhaustive key search. In this paper we develop the first hardware architecture for the cryptanalysis of Hitag2 by means of exhaustive key search. Our implementation on the Cost-Optimized Parallel Code-Breaker COPACOBANA is able to reveal the secret key of a Hitag2 transponder in less than 2 hour (103.5 minutes) in the worst case. The speed of our approach outperforms all previously proposed attacks and requires only 2 sniffed communications between a car and a tag. Our findings thus define a new lower limit for the cloning of car keys in practice. Moreover, the attack is arbitrarily parallelizable and could thus be run on multiple COPACOBANAs to decrease the time to find the secret key.The work is mainly refered to a design and an implementation of applications for mobile operating system Android.

requires controlled and repeatable environment. The complexity of these systems
and their protocols severely lowers feasibility of simulation in this regard.
The solution that permits the use of the actual applications and associated
protocols in the controlled and repeatable environment is emulation. Emulation
allows real hosts to communicate through a transparent virtual network modelling
the real network. However, the virtual network is often created by the emulation
layer placed in the operating system\\\'s kernel posing a certain challenges
regarding practical usability -- the features needed for creating the
environment are there but a significant expertise is required to properly use
them. In addition, the components in the kernel are often primarily concerned
with practical traffic shaping and Quality of Service in general rather than
emulation. This work presents a framework significantly simplifying the creation
and configuration of the network emulation environment while pointing out and
helping avoid some common pitfalls an unsuspecting user might run into. Those
wishing for more in-depth look on the possibilities for network emulation on
Linux are presented with an extensive theoretical background and host of related
work.This thesis documents the design, implementation and evaluation of a flexible, highly customizable device that can passively capture, store and actively replay Fast Ethernet traffic with high timing precision.

To meet these requirements, a set of enhancements was introduced in the pcap library and device drivers. On top of the improvements, the author identified, collected and adapted a set of recent technologies to originate a $100, 680MHz, commercial off-the-shelf MIPS device capable of capturing and generating full speed Fast Ethernet traffic with high timing precision and without any impact on the analyzed network. Additionally, performance of this device was challenged in Gigabit Ethernet and contributed to successful optimization of the software part beyond the Fast Ethernet borders. 

The performance of the device was compared against commonly used Linux tools (tcpdump and tcpreplay) running the same platform. Measurements show that the generation rate is up to three times higher than of tcpreplay. Furthermore, the capturer can handle 30% higher data and packet rates and the tests reveal that the precision reaches down to 4 microseconds, which is twice the precision achieved with tcpdump.

Based on the research of various rapid web-development tools a weak spot in the current approach is identified - the information about the structure and content of the original design file is scarcely used in the process of creating the web page.

Based on this fact the thesis further investigates the possibility of obtaining these metadata. An Adobe PhotoShop script is created to demonstrate the ways to retrieve such data. Because of the unexpectedly high volume of data retrieved an attention is paid to their detailed analysis with a goal to identify such metadata which would allow the programmer to convert them directly or with just little intervention into the front-end code of a web page. A simple pilot application written in PHP is then created to prove the concept viable.Regular tree expressions are a natural formalism for describing the sets of tree-structured values.

This master\\\'s thesis is concerned with the protection of user\\\'s privacy on
the social web. At present, the decision about sensitivity of information a
user wants to publish is left entirely to him/her. The complexity of
specifying right sharing restrictions for each piece of information,
however, is great because the user has to consider the information content
and its social context. The user has to also have knowledge about the
propagation of the information in the environment of the social web. Even if
the user is able to determine the right sharing restrictions, he/she then
has to specify it manually.

The contribution of this thesis is a semi-automatic mechanism that helps the
user to determine sensitivity of published information and propose a
recommended set of recipients. The input of the mechanism is formally
represented by newly proposed language that allows to describe
privacy-relevant data and sharing rules. The developed mechanism also
includes a module for automated annotation of published information, which
greatly improves the usability of the tool. To evaluate and demonstrate the
mechanism, a prototype was developed for the Facebook platform. The
evaluation results show that if the mechanism correctly annotates input
information, it can correctly suggest on average 72% of the users who
should be prevented from seeing the information.The subject of this work is an implementation of a web application for tagging people on photos on any web page. Solution consists of a server which runs on Google App Engine cloud platform and therefore can handle large amount of users.

retaining the necessary speed. The proposed method is tested on a car detection problem.The article discusses the mobile telemetry system intended for the monitoring of the current states of soldiers of the Czech army. The modular alignment of the system makes possible the effective combination of sensor arrays in such a way, as to give the unit commander the maximum amount of available information concerning the current state of his soldiers. The object of the system is to improve the commander‘s uptake of information regarding the state of his unit, to allow him better decisions, to eliminate injuries caused by exhaustion, and to improve the combat efficiency of the unit as a whole. The monitoring system can be also used during training to improve the efficiency of training. Software for the visualisation of the monitored values is an inseparable part of the system. The commander may choose from several modes of display, so that he has access to the necessary information in a simple and easy-to-reach way. Thorough testing of the system at the military base in Pøáslavice has verified the functionality of the system and its usability under field conditions. This work presents a method for searching images based on their visual similarity and its use in forensic analyzer OFA. It will provide users with an effective tool for working with the images. This method allows reliable image search, which is independent of the file names and other detailed descriptions. To do so, application uses an external tool (with included library), which was chosen among other similar tools. Important aspects of the decision were functionality and implementation and also the compatibility with OFA. As a result, new extension to OFA comes with image search based on examples and should bring new possibilities to the field of computer forensics. It should also benefit from simple controls and relevant results.The objective of the project JkCrud is to create generated user interface for database access.

We list several tree distance metrics, of which the general ordered tree distance as the most common is used in the rest of this paper. Then we describe and compare several tree edit distance algorithms and approximate subtree matching algorithms. Comparison technique used is mostly theoretical.

In the second part we show how to use the dynamic programming tree edit distance algorithms to solve a bounded approximate subtree matching problem. In addition, we propose an improvement of two approximate pattern matching algorithms using different generalizations of the subtree pattern. Embedding tree edit distance algorithm would be inefficient, so our effort is focused on adjusting those algorithms (or adding another functionality to those internally) to satisfy approximate pattern matching. 

An extensible implementation of Zhang and Shasha\\\'s tree edit distance algorithm is provided in a form of Java SE library.This work aims to create a utility, exploiting structures of the EDuArd system, that would perform a sequential logic synthesis.

Maybe the easiest way to understand it properly is with hostnames on the Internet where the discomfort that most people feel with remembering numeric identifiers led to the very quick adoption of a name system for devices. In the 1970s and early 1980s, names were given to machines and these names maintained in host tables. The TCP/IP host table name system worked well for a number of years with a centrally-maintained master list used by device administrators to ensure a consistent view of the network. But such a system only works well when the number of devices is small. As the Internet grew, numerous weaknesses became apparent in the host table method. The problems were structural and a completely new approach was needed for using the names on the Internet. So this can be considered to be the impulse for creating Domain Name System (DNS), which is now major system for distributing hostnames on the Internet. But naming services aren’t for hostnames only. Other naming services like LDAP, NIS or Active Directory are used mainly in companies for centralized administration of data.The aim of this diploma thesis is to design and analyze Business Information System for small and medium enteprises and its implementation.

Trendy v programování smìøují k vy¹¹í efektivitì psaní kódu. Za tímto úèelem jsou vytváøeny rùzné generátory kódu. Tímto zpùsobem se u¹etøí mnoho èasu pøi vytváøení projektù a hlavnì se programátor mù¾e koncentrovat na problém samotný. MDD (Model Driven Development) jde v tomto smìru je¹tì dále. Sna¾í se vyu¾ívat pro generování samotný model. Model mù¾e být pou¾it pro generování kostry øe¹ení a struktury dat, tzv. Forward Engineering. Reverzním in¾enýrstvím mù¾eme naopak získat dokumentace k hotovému projektu pro jeho sna¾¹í pochopení. Nejvíce vyu¾ívaným nástrojem souèastnosti pro vytváøení takové dokumentace je standard UML (Unified Modeling Language). UML sám o sobì je¹tì nevytváøí plnohodnotný model. Aby se tak stalo, je tøeba doplnit modely o popisy rùzných integritních omezení. Pro tento úèel obsahuje UML jazyk OCL (Object Constraint Language). V souèasné dobì neexistuje ¾ádný CASE nástroj, který by umìl spolehlivì vygenerovat tato ingritní omezení do SQL. V této návrhové práci se budu zabývat mo¾nostmi, které lze pou¾ít ke konstrukci SQL z existujícího UML doplnìného o OCL.

Our bachelor thesis broadened Domingos’ formulation of “Occam’s second razor” and focused on dependencies between amount of models trained, complexity of the models and testing error. Domingos’ claim that overfitting depends on amount of models trained was experimentally verified too. We used custom software for the experiments . The experiments were performed  on 30 classification and 7 regression tasks using two partially heuristic and two random algorithms.

The experiment results showed several tendencies — according to Wilcoxon test, overfitting is indeed dependent on amount of models trained and independent on complexity of the models. Dependency of testing error and overfitting on complexity is specific to individual datasets (overall trend does not exist). Testing error is independent on amount of models trained.The scope of employment is to design and implement desktop application in the language of JavaFX.

This thesis addresses the problem of long-term object tracking in video sequences. The
tracked object is defined by it’s possition in the first frame, the goal is to track this object
in a video where it changes shape, gets fully or partially occluded or it leaves the scene
and comes back later. This task is crutial for many real life applications. Recently, a
solution was proposed by a novel approach for long-term tracking, called Tracking-Modeling-
Detection (TMD). This metod consists of object tracking, detecting and modeling it’s visual
appearance. These three sub-systems are connected in one functional system, which address
problem of long-term object tracking.
The goal is to implemented TMD in C++ programming language and encapsulate it’s
functionality to C++ library. Next step is to use this library to design simple demo application,
which will demonstrate TMD method. Additional task is to implement a new
tracking method based on color distribution of object to TMD tracking subsytem. Section
focused on experiments targets subsystems of TMD in purpose of improving them. Method
supporting robust object tracking based on estimation of object structure and surrounding
component connected to object of interest was proposed. Experiments are also focusing
on comparing different kind of measurement of features, which serve to object detection,
and features placement within the object.

In the second part we analyse the problem and design our own solution. It includes a description of the LCS (longest common subsequence) algorithm principle and its implementation in the Diff comparison tool, and also an evaluation of usage of this algorithm in the database structure comparison tool. Furthermore we introduce another approach using an object model and its benefits against the diff one. We describe the model and different methods of its creation – by analysing the database directly through a database connection and by parsing an SQL file (which is the main subject of this thesis). We describe the principle of the three parts of the file analyzer (input system,  lexical analyzer and syntactical analyzer) and the basics of  using grammars and recursive descent for parsing files, which we use in our application. Then we describe how the models are compared and how the resulting synchronization script is generated. In the last part we describe the structure of created application.
This thessis deals with designing and development of a motion tracking system, built on a priciple of computing the distance by measuring the delay of acoustic signal. There are serval transmitters, attached to the tracked objects in the envirovement, which generates a short ultrasonic pulse in the given moment. This pulse is captured by fixed receivers with known position. All the units are synchronised, so the receivers are able to measure the time delay between generating and reception of the pulse and derive the distance from source. When this is done by three and more receivers, it is possible to compute the position of the transmitter.

After construction of the system, there were proven serval imperfections in design and component\\\'s function, so the system is not working well.  This bachelor thesis deals with physics engines in computer games,their potential and
field of use on platform Microsoft .NET.It further describes physical fundamentals
of automobiles.At the end,application of a physics engine is described on a computer game

The conversion should apply the most effective ways of data presentation utilising the level of detail concept, thus maximising visual quality and speed of processing. 3D data are exported into COLLADA format and the database information storing objects locations and other related information is processed during the placement of these objects into Google Earth environment and stored as attributes of the generated KML reference file of respective models. The level of detail concept used in Virtual Old Prague was not used for exported files because of a different approach toward this tool in the destination application. The methods presented in this thesis are working good and the conversion and placement of models is automated. The resulting scenery in Google Earth enriched by 3D data from Virtual Old Prague is interesting. However, the missing depth of many models, created primarily for other purposes, is sometimes disturbing. It is to consider the quality and, especially, the nature of models - whether it is desirable to improve the existing models and export them the way described here or create brand new models within the intentioned environment with the possibility of using imagery and geometry of the existing ones.The aim of this work was to create a CRM system as a Web application that will serve the customer line operators in the company Cortex s.r.o..

There are many options for working with geographic data. The main pillar of the proposal is the form of its storage. This work compares methods of storage and data definitions: using Oracle Spatial, then in the database engine based on platform SQL, XML-based techniques, in particular GML and data definitions with ObjectStore, in which this project is implemented.

ObjectStore offers a different view of the storage of geographic data into a database. We can create classes in C++ programming language and then store the objects into a database. To save the implemented city, the proposition of its structure was required - walls, roofs, dormers,... 

There was demand to display the saved spatial data. The tool OpenGL was used for it. We impose certain requirements on dispalying spatial data, such as geometric constraints - we show only part of the town or just houses with some characteristic. Due to increasing demands on performance, it is necessary to implement various optimization techniques. This could be for example, techniques of imaging with different levels of detail. This work describes  all of these querying and viewing techniques and implements them.

After creating the database and its visualization it is necessary to test the correct functionality of the application and the appropriate design of the graphical interface. It must be as user intuitive as possible. Verify of the correct design was performed using a usability test. Based on the results of this test, small changes in the original proposal for a graphical interface was made.This bachelor`s thesis deals with the analysis of factors which influence the process of human learning.

It is an object of the present master thesis to propose a method for modelling natural language with the purpose of machine translation. A further object of the thesis is to design and implement an application allowing embodiment of this modelling method and translation of text in natural language based on the said method. The translation is based on applying user-defined formal rules of context-free attribute grammar for any natural language and the use of a language-independent symbolic representation of meaning (interlingua). The interlingua is implemented as an ontology. The method of modelling natural language has its theoretical foundation in the theory of valency.This thesis is concerned with a design of artificial intelligence opponent for strategic web-based game Insect world. It\\\'s a game that encourages strategic thinking and forces players to cooperate. It is also possible to play duels where individual\\\'s skills are proved. Despite its simplicity it takes beginners a few matches before they acquire the basic tactics and learn game systems. Therefore an artificial opponent was developed within this thesis, whose main goal is teaching beginners. Algorithm design of artificial opponent is based on decision trees and influence maps. An attempt to use neural 
networks did not bring expected results. Testing with live players showed that the proposed artificial opponent still has many deficiencies, but he even managed to defeat live player. In the future there is a space for improvements in quality. An interesting perspective is use of evolutionary algorithms for development of decision trees.My bachelor thesis is dedicated to the topic of design of laboratory exercise and experiments with PCI Express bus.

Applications output is then a text file with results of monitoring or real time visualization.

The whole system is divided into several modules mutually communicating via a standard protocol. This divide allows for easy replacement of modules and for distribution between more computers. The entire system is checked by the control module, which is viable in GUI mode and from the command line.The requirements on modern mobile networks are very complex today and the networks with static infrastructure are not able to fulfill them effectively. First and foremost the quick reconfiguration and adaptation are demanded therefore the ad-hoc networks are utilized more often. These net¬works are more flexible but thanks to the lacking central infrastructure there emerges other complication, e.g. with a topology control of the network. The topology control is implemented because decreasing of interference. The decreasing of interference causes the improvement of communication efficiency, better utilization of communication links and decrease of the power consumption of mobile stations.
Still all existing researches deal with the topology control of networks based on ideal isotropic antennas. This paper compares the results of traditional algorithms with adapted algorithms when using anisotropic antennas. Therefore a model of the anisotropic ad-hoc networks has been proposed and then the simulation system for measurement of network parameters has been implemented. The results of traditional algorithms and adapted algorithms have been compared using this simulation system.This work is considering with subject of Role Playing Games.

It aims at establishing the most often used structures, and visualizing them in a simplified form, and drawing all the other classes in a style which is used for their implementation within the given language. With the help of Java Reflection, giving us an interface for taking down the information about the objects runtime, is as a feedback created an inner form of the original object which is consequently drawn. To draw it though, it was necessary to take advantage of the knowledge of the theory of graphs, and thus design an algorithm which can draw general graphs of reasonable sizes. As it still poses an NP problem to draw such graphs, it was essential to implement such tools in the program that will facilitate work with more complex visual images to the user. This is mainly about joint shifting of various hierarchic groups of nodes.

This way we have managed to come to a complex solution that will make the work of software advance designers easier when debugging programs themselves. At the same time, we have created a teaching aid, which is able to demonstrate the specific features of JAVA language.This bachelor thesis inquires into desing and implementation of virtual network simulator composed of cisco-based routers for subject Y36PSI Poèítaèové sítì.

Purpose of this work is to provide new insights into tree algorithms in the context of Arbology,
a new algorithmic field focusing on formal analysis of trees [10]. This thesis describes new
algorithms for finding exact and approximate (Relabel operation considered only[3]) repeats of
trees, alternative to those from [15]. We describe a tree compression algorithm that respects
the tree’s inner structure in the compressed output. We propose algorithms for tree pattern (including
tree template) matching. All the algorithms proposed here rely on a finite deterministic
automaton, that has been named Tree Compression Automaton. It can be constructed in either
O(n × log2n) time and O(n) space or in O(n) time and O(n2) space. The derived algorithms
have often the same computational complexity.     This thesis studies the occurrence of electromagnetic side channels of contactless smart cards and implements a system for analysis of radio frequency emissions of smart cards.

The reason for creating this project is that there are only few computer programs, which would educate children by playing game. This thesis deals with one part of the project -- implementation of games themself using GamLab tool and their testing. Game scenarios are created to support grafomotoric abilities, object localization abilities, fixation on object, scanning, tracking and so on. Several games were created as a result of this work: Recognize an animal (searching an animal by name), What footprints do they have (connecting footprints and animals), What sounds do they make (searching an animal by sound), Where do they live (giving animals into right living places). The games were tested on a target group of three children and after that were handed over to ©kola Jaroslava Je¾ka.Rendering is a process of generating a 2D image from a mathematical description of a 3D scene. There are many ways to approach this task, driven by demands of a particular application. From animated movies, where the visual quality is the primary goal, to interactive applications (e.g. computer games), where the time available to render one frame is not much more than a few milliseconds. 

The ray tracing algorithm has long been used for offline rendering, and the rendering times were far from interactive. But as the performance of rendering hardware increases, ray tracing becomes an option for interactive applications. 

In this thesis, I will focus on the two different areas of the use of the ray tracing algorithm. I will attempt to implement an interactive application for the synthesis of images based on the ray tracing algorithm, with the option to render a particular view in much higher visual quality, though not in real-time. A general algorithm for text detection and recognition in real-world images is presented in this paper, which due to numerous problems is a harder task than standard printed document recognition. The algorithm finds text areas in photographs taken by a standard camera or a mobile phone and ``reads\\\'\\\' content of the detected text areas, even when the text occupies just a small part of the image, when the camera is not aimed directly at the text and when lighting conditions are not perfect.

The algorithm uses many innovative pieces, such as simultaneous processing of multiple text line hypothesis, feedback loops to correct wrong decisions of previous steps, use of synthetic fonts to train the algorithm (so that there is no need for time-consuming acquisition and labeling of real-world training data) or character recognition based on line context using a typographic model.

The algorithm was tested on four datasets of real-world images, from which two datasets are public and they have been already used to evaluate performance of other existing methods for text detection and recognition. The proposed algorithm outperforms the other existing methods by reading correctly 71\\\\% respectively 60\\\\% characters in these two datasets, thus achieving the state-of-the-art results.

We conclude by showing possible applications of the proposed algorithm, such as automatic indexing of images with text into a database, automatic information retrieval for mapping applications, mobile phone application to help blind people, automatic system for drivers that warns about surrounding traffic signs or an automatic translator of foreign signs and labels. The algorithm was also successfully tested on cyrillic text.The bachelor thesis deals with nding solutions for applications written in Adobe Flex framework.

An efficient method of conversion of rich 3D data content from Virtual Old Prague project is searched for so that the exported data could be visualised and presented in Google Earth application. The conversion should apply the most effective ways of data presentation utilising the level of detail concept, thus maximising visual quality and speed of processing. 
3D data are exported into COLLADA and the database information storing models location and other related information is processed during the placement of files into Google Earth environment and stored as KML attributes of respective models. The level of detail concept used in Virtual Old Prague was not used for exported files because of a different approach toward this tool in the destination application.
The methods presented in this thesis are working, however, the visual quality of results needs to be improved by revamping or substituting the exporting tool and optimising the steps of models placement process. 
Also, it is to consider the quality and, especially, the nature of models - whether it is desirable to improve the existing models and export them the way described here or create brand new models within the intentioned environment with the possibility of using imagery and geometry of existing.This work presents a new AIML interpreter written in the Java programming language. The
AIML language is used to write programs for conversation between humans and computers

specication doesn´t scale well with an increasing amount of contexts. Using techniques
from automata theory a more compact and scalable character-based implementation of the
algorithm is described, implemented and compared to a word-based approach.

Recent software applications can help and guide their users if they know what tasks they are going to perform. They can, for example, provide a template for this task or provide a specific tutorial for this task.  The widely used method to discover what the users have in mind, is to ask them in advance. In this case, users are provided with a possibility to select from a specific template to work with. This work introduces a different approach that is based on recognizing tasks from users’ actions. This approach, a task model inference, is based on having: first, task models for the software and second, an algorithm that based on the users’ actions selects the one that they are performing. This study presents the way how to create the task models, the algorithms that can select among them and discusses possible extensions to these algorithms.Travel agency Honza needs new information system, which will be flexible, fast and

but home that goes to work. I would like to write my thesis about smart home possibilities
(theoretically), which are available, or proposed to the market. Then I would like to design
(practically) part of smart home according to available technologies. I am more considered
with the software part of the problem, but I want to use real hardware if it would be possible
rather then a simulator.
Software should be portable, written in JAVA, using Open Source Solutions and
Technologies. It should be able to manage all smart home interfaces and extensible. Brain of
the system should be Neural Network, which should be able to learn automatically the
inhabitants\\\' behaviors and help them in their everyday routine. “Make technologies disappear
and you have succeeded.”
For example, if system finds out that some switch is turning on every time after doors
are open, it will turn it on automatically. But it should consult this decision in the beginning to
avoid collisions with human decision (according to Asimov rules). These shall avoid starting
mixer with nothing in it, or even turning lights on when nobody is at home.
The system shall communicate through the network, which could be wired, or
wireless. After searching the technologies available I decided to concentrate on open
standard KNX.This thesis focuses on the implementation of ray tracing acceleration structures on different architectures. It summarizes methods for construction and traversal of these structures, both space partitioned (e.g. KD-tree) and object partitioned (e.g. Bounded

This work deals with badly written code and a way to ﬁx it using a transformation tool, which is a program we give input ﬁle with the source code and ﬁle with rules. These are automatically applied to the input code which is changed by them. The transformation tool
creates new ﬁle after conversion, where is already transformed source code.
I do not mean bad working but bad within the meaning blind and ugly written code. When I write about mistakes then I mean mistakes where the code works but is not written well and may be hard to orient in it or may be more exacting then it should. I try to make ﬁxing and optimizing code automatic.
I have found several programmer’s mistakes. But all of them can’t be ﬁxed by using base transformation rules. I describe rules which can be applied to the code but also which can’t be applied with tools actually accessible.This text is part of implementation thesis, whitch will be direct to create

of computer graphics. Predictive image synthesis try to develop methods and algorithms to
estimate the visual appearance of real world scene through the physical accurate global illumination
calculation.
The main goal of this thesis is to create a virtual scene for predictive image synthesis and
verify it against the photographs taken in the real environment. As the virtual scene must
have corresponding visual complexity, we selected the building of Max-Planck-Institute for
Informatics in Saarbrucken. In order to achieve the required image quality it is necessary to
complete the model with light characteristics and surface reflectances. Finally, the scene model
is handed over to physically accurate algorithm for predictive image synthesis, that performs
global illumination calculation. If the image synthesis algorithm is correct, the produced images
will be hardly distinguishable from real photographs.

The result of the thesis is a design and implementation of an algorithm solving the problem. Part of the solution is also a plugin for the NetBeans IDE utilizing the implementation. This thesis focuses on three consequential topics. 
 
The first one is a visualization of 3D slices of GAME models and training data. The models are defined as functions of $n$ inputs and the data are points in this (n+1)-dimensional space. The 3D slice is defined by the selection of two of the inputs as its axes and by setting the remaining n-2 inputs to constant values.  
 
The second problem is the search for such slices that are of some interest to the users. This means that graphs representing individual models have highly varying values on their domain of definition. Moreover, since we are talking about a 3D slice out of an (n+1)-dimension space, the search area is very large. Therefore, I used a special type of genetic algorithm, known as Deterministic Crowding. Its advantage over the classic genetic algorithm is that it is able to find and keep several different and suboptimal solutions. Automatic knowledge extraction is realized in this way - in fact, the models represent data abstraction and the algorithm finds 3D views, in which the model outputs are similar (the abstraction is reliable) and, at the same time, their shapes are complicated. 
 
The third theme covered by this thesis is report generation and automatic reporting. The reports should contain descriptions of slices found in the abovementioned search that are of any interest and their visualization, thus mediating an intuitive and practical overview of the trained models as well as of the knowledge extracted from the data.

programming tasks such as mechanical theorem proving, term rewriting, symbolic computation,
and implementing nonprocedural programming languages.

In this paper, we present new algorithm for nonlinear pattern matching in trees.
Our algorithm is based on traversing acyclic pushdown automaton for trees in prefix and
postfix notation.
The presented pushdown automata are input--driven and therefore can be determinised.
Given a tree of size \\\'n\\\', deterministic subtree or deterministic tree subgraph pushdown automaton
can be constructed for this tree in time linear in \\\'n\\\' and its advantages are:
First, the automaton represents a complete index of the tree and the linear search phase
of all occurrences of a subtree or  connected subgraph of size \\\'m\\\'
is performed in time linear in \\\'m\\\' and not depending on \\\'n\\\'. This is
faster than the time of any of the existing tree pattern matching algorithms,
which depends on \\\'n\\\'. Second, although the number of connected subgraphs can be
exponential in \\\'n\\\', the size of the automaton is linear in \\\'n\\\'. Third, using this automaton
we can create tree signatures allowing subtree comparison for equality to be performed
in constant time. Equality of subtrees is used for nonlinear tree pattern matching.The bachelor thesis deals with analysis, design and implementation of small library information

New project starts with its specification followed by analysis, implementation and tests, generally
these stages repeat in many iterations. It is not only important to have clear documentation of what
needs to be done and how, it is also necessary to keep a track of issues that are encountered during
the development process. Issues have normally a character of a found bug or a feature request. Issue
applies to a given project and its version. Not only a large project will gain from an issue tracking
system even though that for a large project is such a system crucial. Many developers working on a
particular project need a way to communicate what are the tasks that need to be done and who is
responsible for them. Issue tracking system serves not only as a repository for new issues it also
serves the purpose of project management. Manager of a project can assign work to developers and
they assign fixed bugs to testers that re-test the fix. Testers may eventually automate tests for a fixed
bugs, they also report bug they encounter during their testing routine. Manager sees all work that is
being done by his developers, he sees also all fixes and new issues for given application build. The
system applies proper business rules for an issue lifetime.Objective of this work is to design and implement reservation system suitable for use in computer school.

These are backward traceroute and graphical visualization of this route. Animportant feature of the utility is that it makes use of the infrastructure for network performance monitoring -- perfSONAR. It allow to measure performance parameters of the nodes on the network route without direct access to the nodes (ie. SNMP). This is advantageous if we need to get performance parametrs of the nodes where we haven\\\'t got direct access to them and it is unwanted to have this full access. Implementation language of this program is Java. The tracing utilities of the host operating system are used to obtain the sequence of routers along a network path.
World Wide Web Consortium defines Web services as software systems designed to support interoperable machine to machine interaction over a network [7]. In reality there are many Web services that are vendor specific and cannot interact to each other. Usually it is caused by wrong implementation based on ambiguous or incomplete standards.

This new approach to the undo command overcomes the weakness of the linear undo command. It allows undoing an arbitrary action from the history while watching the dependencies among the actions. However, there is not a visualization of cascading undo yet. Thus, in this thesis we discuss, introduce, develop, and evaluate several visualizations for cascading undo. Unlike the linear undo visualizations, cascading undo visualizations have to deal with dependencies among user actions. We believe that an overview of the dependencies should be presented to a user before committing and
undo command. The visualizations we proposed are ﬂexible enough to reﬂect the possible complexity of the user actions and their dependencies.The work represents the result of analysis, design, implementation and testing of single purpose filesystemThis work concentrates on describing a development of a Netbeans IDE module, which should help the community with creating interoperable web services in this environment.

These are general-purpose computations which expose parallelism.
In this thesis, I describe the iterative methods for solving sparse linear systems: the Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, Conjugate Gradient and BiConjugate Gradient method. I explain the architecture of the GPU, their capability of the general-purpose computations and current software platforms which provide an abstraction to the GPU programming: the BrookGPU and RapidMind Multi-core platform. I discuss the iterative methods in the GPU programming environment and describe the implementation for both platforms.
Then I made a performance tests between the sequential algorithms and the algorithms for Brook and Rapidmind. The results of my experiments show that the GPU is better suited for the computation with larger problem dimensions. For the iterative methods, the optimal problem size ~10^6 was observed, where most significant speedup compared
to the sequential implementation was reached. Namely 3x speedup for Brook and 1,5x speedup for Rapidmind. Larger instances (10^7+) encountered a limitation of the graphics API. Brook has been found as faster platform than Rapidmind due to the necessary workarounds in Rapidmind implementation. The general Gauss-Seidel method has been
found as not suitable for processing on the GPUs.Dedicate to questions of Single Sign-On.

We first summarize all the known mesh errors and offer a categorization based on the error nature. For each of the errors a derivation of impact on the number of mesh geometrical primitives is provided. The derived relations are then used to lay down a foundation of a graph theory approach to error detection, a means promising for a constant time complexity with linear time preprocessing. We introduce two techniques to achieve this goal. The core is in describing the mesh properties by a system of linear equations, which reflect the presence of errors in the mesh. In addition to this, we describe an auxiliary method which exploits the inevitable preprocessing to the maximum to get as much information as possible.This work considers creation of driver for file system Journaling Flash File System version 2 for OpenSolaris.

and speech recognition tasks. The solution is based on multiplatform
applications on the basis of WWW applets using the architecture client - server.
Within the initial part I have created the program recording localy audio signal
on client side and sending its then to the server where further processing is realized.
The first application deals with algorithms for speech enhancement
based on spectral subtraction which is implemented in external program CtuCopy (the more general tool for speech enhancement and parameterization) running at the server side. The new audio signal is sent back to the client which can observe it as waveform or spectrogram. It is also possible to play original or
enhanced speech signal on the client side.
Secondly, I realized a demostration of speech recognition within a
voice controlled WWW pages. User can control by voice scrolling of WWW pages (up, down), browsing in the history of pages, or showing new pages according to standard WWW links. Two simple task were
chosen for this demonstrative purposes: simulation of telephone number dialing and on department personnel list with brief contact information. An important part of this application was the creation of energy based detector of speech activity as only the signal containg a speech should be sent to the server side for the recognition.

In this thesis we show parallel simulation methods of finite automata (FA) based on the Basic simulation, Bit parallelism and Dynamic programming methods. We compare the parallel
methods with well known sequential versions of these methods and find whether and under what
conditions is worthy to use the parallel methods of simulation of run of finite automata.
Contrary to the fact, that there are methods of sequential simulation of FA run with nice time
complexities, we can reach the moment, when the time needed to finish the simulation grows over
acceptable bounds (e.g. in case of very large input text). Then, we need to find another solution.
One of possible solutions can be running the simulation in parallel.
We introduce the paralell simulation methods for general DFA and NFA, which are universal,
but due to the dependency of simulation time on the number of states |Q| of automaton being
simulated, they are suitable only for simulations of run of automata with the smaller number of
states.
On the other hand, if we apply some restrictions to properties of automata being simulated,
we can reach the linear speedup compared to the sequential simulation method. First, we show
methods benefiting from k-locality and then we introduce (q0, k)-synchronizability, that allows
optimal parallel simulation of exact and approximate pattern matching automata.
Finally, we show the results of experiments conducted on two types of parallel computers
(Cluster of workstations and Symmetric shared-memory multiprocessors). In these experiments,
we measure time of run of programmes implemented according to introduced parallel algorithms
and compare it with sequential simulations.Significance of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) is more popular in these days. Their improvement covers broad part of human work.

The word-based text compression is a novel compression approach which exploits high correlation
between words in the sentence. This approach allows us to achieve not only better
compression ratio but even better compression and decompression time. Basic idea of wordbased
compression methods is to consider the words as source units instead of characters.
Almost all known compression methods (statistical, dictionary and even context) can be advanced
on word-based compression methods. We focus in our work on statistical word-based
compression methods.

We present two word-based statistical compression methods in the thesis. First of them
is implementation of Dense Coding and is oriented on compression and decompression time
performance. Second implementation is word-based arithmetic code and is more oriented on
compression ratio. The implementations are based on proposals of previous works from Hor-
spool, McCormack, Brisaboa, de Moura, Navarro and Moffat.

We present also experiments and comparison to other compression methods (character-based
and even word-based). At the end we summarize our results and propose some ideas and
possible improvements in the word-based compression.This diploma work deals with user interface development using Microsoft Windows Presentation Foundation technology.

On the Czech Technical University in Prague, the forensic analysis team is working on the development of a forensic analyzer tool for use in the investigation process of the software criminality. The basic demand on this tool is to allow an analysis of several data sources and representations. Our primary objective was to obtain as much as possible information about the data stored on a physical media like hard disks, compact disks, diskettes, etc., that are relevant for the investigator. This involves a rich file system support.

The goal of this work is to extend available file system support of our forensic analyzer which was platform dependant and its use was thus very limited. That leaded us to the idea to add the file system code directly to the forensic analyzer tool. New file system interface was designed which supports exactly the functionality we need. As inspiration the Linux Virtual File System has been used. Support of particular file systems results from the Linux File System code too. In this work it is described how the Linux file system code was changed, to make it usable in other operating systems, especially Microsoft Windows. Beside this, support of other functionalities
was added, like reading hidden or deleted files.The thesis is focused on using the CAS (Computer Algebra System), specifically solution Mathematica in Physics teaching on high schools.

During this examination, patients are sitting on a special rotating chair. Their eye movements together with the driving signal of the chair are recorded. For healthy patients, the eye movement signal should contain the same frequencies as the driving signal does. However, the eye movement signal contains a movement correction, called saccades, which make the direct application of  the FFT for obtaining the frequencies unsuccesful. In this work, we present  a new method of saccade detection using computational intelligence (algorithm GAME). We have also implemented a new program RecBob for saccade removal and signal reconstruction.  The proposed method is experimentally validated on real data from Motol hospital. All frequencies contained in  the signal were successfully identified.Ten years ago, an open-source real-time operating system called eCos, designed to create embedded systems, was developed in Cygnus Solutions.

The aim of this work is to develop an application that will permit Cisco IP phone to control an IP camera. The application will enable the IP phone to choose one IP camera from a list of available IP cameras and it will consequently show the IP camera video stream on the IP phone’s display. Because of constrained capabilities of the IP phone the video stream will be displayed as a sequence of images. Images will be periodically refreshed at the highest possible frequency. Additionally, the application will provide control of the IP camera (pan, tilt and zoom) based on the camera capability. Finally, the solution will be tested in real deployment.In this thesis we discuss problems of generating soft shadows in real-time. The thesis is divided into three parts. The first part represents an introduction to real-time rendering and illumination. The second part surveys the most popular shadowing methods. In the third part we present our method which exploits capability of recent graphic hardware and which produces physically correct soft shadows at interactive framerates for mediocre scenes. In the conclusion we perform an analysis of both visual and performance properties of each method and we summarize their advantages and drawbacks. We also provide a demonstrating software which implements all described methods.The main aim of this bachelor work was to create a library from already existing tool Espresso, designed for minimization of logical functions.

To test the fundamental functionality, I will test users ability of authentification to selected services on my system using Kerberos and LDAP services.In this document I am involved in a preparation of a system of a uniform authenticity, so called \\We describe three simple algorithms for solving the problem of approximate string matching. This problem is defined as finding of all occurrences of a pattern string (length m) in a text string (length n) with at most k mismatches. These are the naive algorithm, Approximate Boyer-Moore string matching algorithm from authors Tarhio and Ukkonen, and Efficient string matching with k mismatches algorithm from authors Landau and Vishkin. For the last mentioned algorithm we develop new method for the pattern preprocessing and suggest an improvement that changes the space complexity of this algorithm from O(k(m+n)) to O(km+n). All these algorithms are thoroughly tested and the results are then compared.

Then we deal with the problem of two-dimensional approximate pattern matching. This problem is defined as finding of all occurrences of an m_1 x m_2  pattern array embedded as sub-arrays in an n_1 x n_2 array of text, where at most k mismatches are allowed per occurrence. We describe the naive2D algorithm, Two-dimensional pattern matching using finite automata method from author Jan ®ïárek, and Two-dimensional pattern matching with k mismatches algorithm from authors Ranka and Heywood. This last method generalizes the idea of Landau and Vishkin\\\'s algorithm into two dimensions, therefore new pattern preprocessing and lesser space complexity are developed for this algorithm as well. The space complexity changes from O(k(m_2+n_2)+m_1m_2+n_1n_2) to O(m_2(k+m_1)+n_1n_2). Even these algorithms are tested on several kinds of images to find out their properties and results are then compared.The thesis deals with analysis of a global illumination usage in interactive applications. Global illumination computations are based on physically correct light transfer principles, two major computation methods are raytracing and radiosity. Due to heavy computations, global illumination methods are usually approximated in interactive applications using specific techniques. Properties of human perception are usually taken in account during the process. Radiosity-based methods seem to have better perspective for interactive application use, mainly due to real-time performance on a state-of-the-art hardware. The result of this thesis is a simple computer game featuring global illumination that is computed using the radiosity method.

It is focused in detail on the ciphers DES, Zodiac and CSA which are recently in use. A part of this work is also an analysis of robustness of those ciphers in relation to number of rounds and chosen cryptanalytic method. First section (review) consists of description of cipher modes, important definitions, cipher algorithms characterization and cryptanalytic method description. Second section is more practically focused and it demonstrates the robustness of DES, Zodiac and CSA when attacked by linear, differential and algebraic analysis, respectively.
The robustness analysis results are in accordance with our prediction. CSA appears to be the most stable ciphering system followed by Zodiac and DES, which is limited by short key length. The most effective attack seems to be the linear cryptanalysis which enabled to get over the highest number of rounds for each of tested ciphers. Although the algebraic cryptanalysis has a great potential and should be promoted in the future.The work deals with an implementation of some carry adders and it draws a comparison among them on the basic of complexity and delay.

There is the problem to create such a simplification, which guarantees an optimal combination of rendering speed and given visual quality.

For such purposes I will use structure called billboard cloud. This representation consists of set of textured, partially transparent polygons (billboards), which create feeling of real model. There are many techniques how to create the billboard cloud, but I will try to suggest some other solutions convenient both for simplification of vegetation and for common models.

I will introduce new representations of billboard clouds. I will present the method how to analyze model according density and the method used for billboard clouds generation relative to orientation of model\\\'s geometric primitives. Finally, I will compare efficiencies of these methods and their conveniency for complex model\\\'s simplification.The fist part of this text focuses on the analysis of the possible causes of data corruption of PostgreSQL data files.

their daily operations. To start the project, first it was needed to understand how they go
about their daily business and if there were any software solutions for any of their
operations.
The projected started in the second half of 2007, under the direction of Ing. Bo¾ena
Mannová, M.Math., and explored exactly the first criteria. It was found that only 1 of
their operations was handled by a fully functional and specialized software solution, that
being the selling of drinks (bar sales) and this lead to an in depth understanding of the
system that was used, namely Mefisto Gourmet. Once this process was complete, the
next stage of the project was undertaken; the design and implementation of a complete
software solution for this problem. This was overseen by Ing. Martin Bloch, CSc.
To create a good design, it was decided to review all the operations in the club, taking
into account guest lists, VIP reservations, ticket sales, bar systems and payrolls. Only
then is it possible to create an architecture that is fully compatible with the problem at
hand. Once this was done, personas were created to find the necessary personal
requirements that this software needed to handle as well as the requirements of the
problems that needed to be solved. After the definition of the requirements, the
architectures were designed, namely the Conceptual, Data and Data Dependency
models, which showed how the program should be constructed and how it works
together with all the actors (managers, bar tenders, ticket sales agents and clientele).
The last stage of this project was to create and prove that such an implementation is not
only viable, but useful once it is created. To achieve this goal, it was decided to take a
subset of the Conceptual model and implement it with the majority of its features. Once
this was complete, the models were reviewed after the software of locally tested by a
handful of people to show that the software is useful. Extensive testing will be needed in
the further design including the use of Usability Labs to tests the interface as well as the
final product.
The conclusion of the project was such that a solution like this is not only viable, but
also useful in the club management field, and if further development was to be done, it
would definitely be recommended. Such software can not only increase efficiency but
also increase accuracy of results (i.e. ticket sales, reducing conflicts in reservation
systems etc.). Changes to the current architecture may be required but the system as it
is now, is working and is in a structure that can be easily built on top. Thus this project
was a useful undertaking that can lead to full scale useful software as a real world
solution to club management operations.The work describes a part of WDM drivers for communication with device which conform to IEEE 1667 standard and implemntation of part of this device.

FPGA. Such system could be used for example in systems on chip, FPGA
implemented. The core idea is the implementation of a tester with the help of FPGA
reconfiguration instead of using classical self testing equipment implemented on the
FPGA with original design system on chip. I have designed a model for testing of one
circuit, which is based on the IEEE Standard 1149.1 (Boundary-Scan). I have
subsequently applied this model on testing other circuits. During the testing, FPGA
reconfiguration was carried out manually; i.e. for each test step I have prepared
special bitstream and these bitstreams were loaded into the FPGA. This approach
guarantees that all circuits are tested. When the test is finished, it is possible to load
into FPGA a bitstream, which configures the system into the original function mode.This master thesis deals with the creation of an information system supporting the agenda of abroad studies for the use of the faculty of electrical engineering.

Shadows are very important in computer graphics. They increase the level of realism and provide very strong depth cues. Without shadows generated images will never appear realistic. Real-time shadow generation is based on two main approaches - shadow maps and shadow volumes. In this thesis we will focus on the first one. 
Shadow maps are very simple, fast and easy to implement. But, shadow map algorithm works in image space, which is source of many problems. Due to the numerical error during trasformations and limited size and precision of z-buffer, shadow maps suffer from aliasing and sampling problems. The goal of this thesis is to explore ways for reducing these problems and improving visual quality of generated shadows.This project is aimed to describe the new trends in development of processors from AMD company.

These
problems are commonly solved by meta-heuristic algorithms. A number of them (e.g. Simulated
Annealing, Ant Colony Optimization) are briefly introduced and Genetic Algorithm and
Tabu Search even with their implementation descriptions. Recently, many so-called hybrid approaches
have been proposed. These methods combine a various (meta-)heuristics to struggle
out their disadvantages and to increase their applicability to more complex data in principle.
Instead of hybridizing one method by another one, we have designed a framework for the alternation
of the meta-heuristic algorithms and implemented two algorithms - Genetic Algorithm
and Tabu Search. We have proposed an alternation strategy the search process is guided by.
The concept of the algorithm alternations is presented and a description of the framework realizing
it as well. Three problems were implemented upon our framework: Satisfiability Problem
(SAT), Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). Finally,
the behavior of the algorithm alternations is demonstrated on experimental results.The goal of this work is to extend transparency of process migration in Clondike project.

That, in contrast with the common LR parser, utilizes the stack in much lesser extent and most of the parse context is stored in the state of the automaton. The goal is to develop a generator of such parsers which from a language grammar creates pushdown automaton for that parser. Grammars are described in the format used in another parser generator Bison. Output from the generator isn\\\'t bound to a specific programming language used for implementing the parser, instead generator returns controll tables for the parser in a macro language format. This makes it possible to implement the parser in arbitrary programming language or simply make changes in the parsing algorithm and perform various measurements.This text covers deep analysis of possibilities of using parallel top down parsing algorithm. 
The method is based on lookback and lookahead strings in analyzed text, having theoretical parallel
time complexity T(n,n) = O(logn) - on condition that n = p. In practice where n &gt;&gt; p,
algorithm achives time complexity of T(n,p) = O(n/p). By simulation of this parallel
algorithm on single computational node we will obtain a sequential algorithm with time complexity of
O(n), which is the same as of the original LL(k) algorithm. The difference between these two
algorithms can be in different multiplicative constants.
This work shows conditions on which
sequentially simulated algorithm can be more effective (in the sense of time complexity) than the
original LL(k) one.

Modified toy should be able to execute movements and monitor/reflect state of its sensors. Additional requirement is to support carrying of audio signal between the toy and controlling PC. This would potentially enable voice control of Furby (voice control doesn’t belong to goals of this thesis).This work is dedicated to the problem of 3D model reconstruction from image sequences of a real object, rotating on a turntable and captured by digital camera. The camera does not change its intrinsic parameters during capturing process and rotates about a single axis. Thanks to the existence of an automatic feature points detection, we are able to describe the geometry of images fully automatically. We reconstruct 3D model with minimal amount of external parameters. The implemented system uses projection matrices to describe the location and intrinsic parameters of the camera. Three-dimensional models, that are processed through a space carving algorithm, are displayed as a set of textured triangles. Application is able to use both manually and automatically calibrated projection matrices. Examples are presented on one dinosaur sequence of images. We compare the automatic and manual camera calibration results of the implemented system at the end of this thesis.This work describes and demonstrates the use of the Eclipse RCP framework by the development of multiplatform desktop applications using principles of Extreme Programming.This work is focused on clustering algorithm which is used for detection areal clusters in data at reconstruction of three-dimensional objects.

Only the modified kNN algorithm has been used in the same way it was implemented previously. These four algorithms are finally compared between each other with the goal to choose algorithm, which reveals manifold data in the best way and separates particular bodies at the same time. For this purpose there are testing data and also real measured data from three-dimensional laser sensors. At the end of the work results of all experiments are compared. On the basis of this results the optimal clustering algorithm is chosen, which is modified K-means algorithm.This bachelor work designs a module for content management system XOOPS implemented in language PHP.

My aim is to evaluate the source code and to research the individual parts of the database management system implemented in eXist and Xindice. These products provide the ability to store XML data, however, there is certainly more than one way to
accomplish that task. Foremost, I will detail the methods of implementation of cache, in-memory representation of XML document, indexing mechanism, persistent storage implementation (etc.) separately for eXist and Xindice.
Furthermore, I will compare and contrast the two. This will be the focus of my thesis.
I will also report the results of the testing that I performed on the set of testing data. The testcases refer mainly to storing data from an external XML file into cache and persistent storage.This paper is based on author’s experience with implementation of an internet domain registry.

The work is concentrated to models defined functionally, more specificaly to implicit and explicit surface definitions. 

Proposed rendering method of such surfaces is modification of ray casting algorithm. This modification has big impact on rendering time complexity and offers an order of magnitude speedup. This reduced rendering time is of course balanced by reduced image quality. The idea of this method is in bounding search space for each shooted ray where the intersection with model is looked for. 

Practical results are brought out in demo program, which is able to render some examples of procedurally defined surfaces on CPU or GPU. This demo program has also abbility to test quality of implemented method against classical error-free ray casting method.

Construction of such automata is mostly easy but they can not be used directly because of their nondeterminism. We can transform NFA to the equivalent deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unfortunately, transformation
may result in DFA having up to 2^|Q| states where |Q| is the number of
states of related NFA. Another approach is a simulation of run of NFA using basic simulation method, bit parallelism or dynamic programming. The simulation using bit parallelism and dynamic programming embody low time and space complexities at the cost of that these methods cannot simulate general NFA (NFA intended for another purpose than approximate pattern matching). On the other hand, basic simulation
method allows us to simulate general NFA of course with higher time and space complexity than bit parallelism and dynamic programming but with lower time and space complexities than determinisation and DFA run.

We introduce the deterministic state cache, a basic simulation method extension based on use of fast memory of used d-subsets (set of active states of NFA), which can under certain circumstances dramatically fasten the basic simulation method. We present two possible implementations of deterministic state cache in C++ language concurrently with implementation of bit parallelism, dynamic programming and determinisation and DFA run.

Finally, we compare basic simulation method extended of deterministic state cache to the other implemented algorithms dependent on various parameters and we show in which cases the use of deterministic state cache is efficient and in which not.The main aim of this thesis is realisation of alternative web interface for original terminal client of Eagle\\\'s Nest BBS.

In my project I intended to learn how to program the graphic hardware and whether doing so is worth it at all. I implemented the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm on both a common CPU and a graphic card. For larger input data the implementation using GPU was almost nine times faster than the same input using just CPU. Hence it can be said in certain parallel computation cases that it is worth it to invest in graphic hardware rather in common processor.The main goal of this project is to design and implement a web application, which allows to manage participants of conferences and other events.

The scenes with glossy surfaces, common in real world, are especially important. Traditional methods are based on environment map prefiltering. The prefiltering process is very time consuming and limits the use of these methods to the scenes with static lighting. Methods based on projecting lighting and BRDFs onto spherical  harmonics basis are only able to simulate low-frequency reflection effects.  The aim of this thesis is to computate environment mapping on glossy objects with high-frequency BRDFs and lighting using wavelets. Wavelets presents excellent tool for high frequency signal  approximation which are just mapped environments with dynamic materials. We address all important aspects necessary for an implementation of environment mapping using wavelets (in particular non-linear wavelet approximation and efficient computation of some operations in wavelets).  We focus on the wavelet rotation operation a solution to which was not known until recently. One can  describe the rotation using a very sparse matrix which is compact and enables elegant and fast computation of rotation. We will show that the model, observer\\\'s location and environment map can all be transformed in an interactively during calculation. Algorithms for wavelet operation shown here are not limited only for calculation of environment mapping. One can use these algorithms in other applications, such as image processing, global illumination, etc.


Keywords: computer graphics, image synthesis, environment mapping, wavelets, non-linear approximation, wavelet rotation, spherical harmonic.

Current computer world is becoming more and more dangerous due to  increasing amount of viruses, malware, spyware, and other malicious software that is spreading across Internet. Today\\\'s tools for compression, encryption, and morphing of the malicious code make the task of their detection even more complex. The goal of this diploma thesis is to analyze, design, and implement an application (for MS Windows XP) that will be able to examine executable files in PE/COFF format for MS Windows x86 32-bit platform using dynamic analysis. The application should dynamically transform the code and emulate its execution in a guarded environment. During the execution, statistical data will be collected and evaluated by a heuristics module (not covered by this diploma thesis), which can eventually stop the execution. The application should decide whether the code is a self-executable archive, and possibly let the code unpack itself.This work describes analysis, design and implementation web aplication for Institute of rheumatology, facilitating doctors filing patiens into the clinical research studies and enabling administration of  projects´ studies.The main aim of the work is to discover explotation of spherical function nelinear optimization in computer graphics for light transport aproximation. The purpose to aproximate transport function is that exploitation of spherical harmonics does not allow rotate around arbitrary axis effecitively. The rotation is possible but a complexity of the problem is too high and it cannot be processed per vertex. One of the aim is to introduce a local deformation of the object. And just the deformation needs to rotate with transfer function fast per each vertex of the model. Zonal harmonics, which are subset of spherical harmonics space, is used for this purpose. The work describes spherical harmonics (SH), derivation of zonal harmonics (ZH) and mainly nelinear optimization used to fit arbitrary spherical function to ZH space. Nelinear optimization is described in great detail even with respect to optimization parameters and behavior of the optimization itself. Next point of the work is backward reconstruction of the transfer function with full explotation of modern graphical hardware. We describe several methods based on various approaches (per vertex or per texel).This bachelor thesis talks about analysis, proposal and realization of a program for file management and picture editing in BMP, JPEG, GIF and PNG graphic formats.

The implementation is created in Java programming language.The aim of this diploma\\\'s thesis is to design a development environment with standard features to speed up and simplify editation of source codes, which are used in standard desktop environments, and which use parser of source code. Our environment will run as hosted application on web browser, it means on-line, which requires very specific conditions. No matter which implementation environment is used (JavaScript, Java, Flash), it itself has higher computing power consumption, therefore it is necessary to choose effective algorithms for analysis. In case of syntactic and lexical analysis we will use efficient incremental parsing and for the implementation we will use JavaScript. In development environment the most important is modularity. Application consists of very simple core with core API, which allows for simple addition or replacement of certain modules. For example incremental parser is just a module and thus it can be replaced with another implementation (eg. using Java or Flash). With respect to universality it is important to have in syntax driven environment a parser generator, that generates state automata based on specified grammar. At the end we will discuss the usability of the application from the point of view of response time.During construction of a model from data is necessary to set
parameters of the model so it will closely describe behavior of the
system which the data describes. There are many methods to solve
this, but it\\\'s very difficult to choose the right one which would be
the most effective. In this work we try to use conjugate gradient
method. Than we are looking for the best configuration for it. The
optimization module based on conjugate gradient method has been
implemented to the GAME. It also allowed to compare performance of
this module with already implemented modules.This work analyzes the state of the genealogical programs and websites and together with the analysis of the usable sources for genealogical data it designs the portal for the genealogical use.

It describes a representation of real numbers, provides a set of algorithms for elementary functions on real numbers and also the implementation of an exact arithmetic library in C/C++ programming language following that paradigm.
There is existing a pure Java library, which works with the same paradigm, but the performance shows a lack of efficiency. So I intended to build an exact arithmetic library ConsReal in C/C++
programming with better performance.
I chose the representation of constructive reals as a functional representation and provided the algorithms for computation of constructive reals. Some of these algorithms are together with their proofs. The ConsReal library contains three components: Class Integer, class Real and class CReal. Class Integer was built with the use of library GMP and it can work well with variable-length integer. Class Real is the interface of the library, it makes things easy to declare a constructive real and to write the expression for computation on constructive reals. The third class CReal is the core of constructive reals. Class CReal has many subclasses, and each subclass has a different approximation function, which is used to generate results guaranteed to be accurate to any error tolerance. Each operation applied on constructive reals works actually with the core and the result will be subclass corresponding to the operation.
The ConsReal library runs faster than the original Java library, but it is still slower than the iRRAM library. It is because of the dierence in principle, the ConsReal library uses top-down
propagation approach, and the iRRAM library uses bottom-up propagation approach. It would
be signicant performance improvement if we could somehow integrate the bottom-up principle
to the ConsReal library.The purpose of the thesis is a camparison of native XML databases (NXD).

The TV news brings new information every day from home and abroad, which is often needed to fill up with graphics. Each pressman orders graphics by necessity to his reportage. These graphics thematically repeat and are modelled in the third dimension for being sightly. In the TV-graphics department, we have a telephone graphics for phone conversation, a pronouncement for text pronouncement, a column graph for election returns, we have the virtual parliament for image of dispensation in the parliament or a restoration graphics of car accidents and more. But it happens very often that our mailbox is filled up with graphics ordered by the pressmen and we cannot catch up with them on time and thus obstruct finishing the reportage. Therefore, it would be obviously suitable to make tools that would make this work easier and allow us to concentrate on work, which cannot be automated. The 3D Studio MAX offers this possibility in its scripting language and that’s why I have thought up and chosen this theme. I consider it to be interesting, but above all very practical and useful for everyday utilization.This diploma thesis deals with creating and managing of the configuration software of the railway signalling and interlocking equipments, describes curent methods and defines a new method that

It deals with transferring digital circuits to a graph model and solves problems with the help of some algorithms from the theoretical information science field. The aim of this work is to suggest a suitable form for graph representation in a disc file. When I use this method for the same problem, it is not necessary to use the format of ISCAS89, which is usually loaded and used. I need only to load the representation of this file, which would be more effective and saves a lot of time and uses less memory. Next aim those work them to a created graph mock - up numerical perimeter carry out chopping sequential perimeter on individual combinational parts. Subsequently these combinational parts can be employed in other they may employ in of other works and implement diagnostics. Once from such washing will perhaps even my subsequent graduation theses deal with sets of inputs and outputs vectors and input specification. Inputs file of digital circuit was selected the format ISCAS89. For others usage is selected entry resulting hacked part circuit to the file in format ISCAS89, programming language C and Pascal.Simatic is a computer program which implements basic mathematical calculations in an intuitive graphic user interface.

In the first part, the most typical degenerancies of polygonal models that originate in CAD systems are listed. Namely the errors are cracks, holes, T-joints, overlaps, dangling walls, duplicated geometry, self intersecting geometry, inconsistent normal orientation, invisible polygons, degenerated faces and concavity errors. Every error is described in detail, an example is given and detection and correction algorithms are presented. Detection methods of the most important of the named errors have also been implemented and are described in the second part of this thesis. 
The implementation is based on processing of boundary edges, which are used to detect most of the errors. Furthermore, the errors detectable by boundary edges represent the largest subset of errors and they represent the most common and the most serious of mesh degenerancies as well. By using boundary edges, we detect cracks, holes, T-joints, overlaps, zero volume parts and inconsistent normal orientation. Apart from these errors, we detect also some cases of duplicated geometry, degenerated faces, and concave faces. We do not detect self-intersecting geometry and invisible polygons.
Models with inconsistent normal orientation and T joints are also corrected. The output of the program is a list of errors present in the mesh. If there were T-joints or normal inconsistencies present in the input model a corrected model is provided in the output as well.This bachelor\\\'s thesis deals with design and implementation of the safety equipment which for transmission information using GSM technology.

also for animals. It constitutes an essential element of their mutual communication. Latest studies
of songbirds\\\' social behavior make it apparent that there are many parallels between the evolution
of birds\\\' natural vocalization and that of human speech. Besides imitation of words (those of human
beings) by itself,  it is their natural phonic expression that is of an overriding importance. This
way of expression can potentially contain even linguistic structures and thus reflect some of the
linguistic expression general features - that of a speech. We can identify this phenomenon also in
case of parrots, which are generally known for their highly developed ability of imitation.

\\Computer Science solves a large quantity of various tasks. One of them is also searching for a given pattern in a text. Searching task can be further specified in several ways and is frequently implemented by finite automata and their simulations. Nondeterministic finite automaton can be constructed with a relatively low time complexity, however its nondeterminism doesn\\\'t enable direct use in praxis. Therefore is convenient to use deterministic finite automata, whose construction is more time-consuming. Nevertheless they search in time that is proportional to the lenght of the text beeing searched. Another alternative is to use a method of simulation of nondeterministic finite automaton.

In case the searched pattern has been changed during the process of searching it is necessary to modify the searching finite automaton, eventually its simulation corresponding\\\\-ly. In this thesis we demonstrate methods that implement this modification. We consider time complexity of these methods, implement them and analyze practical measurments.

However, the theoretical results expose that EDF scheduling brings better performance. It
gave me impetus to implement EDF scheduler in RTEMS.
   In fact, EDF ready queue is more difficult to implement than ready queue with fixed priority
levels since ready tasks have to be order by ascending absolute deadline that changes for each
instance of task and can take th evalue from wide range. I proposed and implementated the
EDF ready queue as Red-Black tree with tasks being directly nodes of the tree. This structure
has the linear space complexity. Time complexity of operations handling the queue is O(log2 n)
in the worst case.

Nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), corresponding to existing searching problem, is usually easy to construct, but it cannot be used directly because of its nondeterminism. Equivalent deterministic finite automaton (DFA), obtained by transforming the NFA can theoretically have up to 2^|Q| states, where |Q| is a number of states of considered NFA. This could be too much in practical use, therefore in these cases we can use a method that simulates a run of NFA. Most general is the basic simulation method, for approximate pattern matching (using Hamming, Levenshtein or Damerau distance) were designed simulation techniques called dynamic programming and bit parallelism. Goal of this thesis is  to inspect other possible methods of simulation of nondeterministic finite automata (focused on the searching automata) and to compare their results (time and space complexity) with methods presented in previous works. One of the method uses the failure function, the other is based on depth-first search algorithm (DFS). This thesis describes the realization of complex system of self-testing circuits testing. The self-testing property and fault security is observed. Testing was done on set of benchmarks. This testing was realized in FPSLIC from ATMEL Company. Dynamic partial reconfigura-tion (driven from embedded AVR) was used to put faults into the FPGA.
This thesis also describes all logic needed to be added to circuits to ensure the measuring of fault security, self-testing and totally self-checking properties. Complete design flow from benchmark to bitstream with benchmark in testing environment is described in detail. Some software tools were made to safeguard the automatic VHDL source code generation and bitstream generation, as much automatic, as possible.
Measuring with couple of benchmarks was done. Results were compared with software simulation of fault injection. 
This document takes advantage of the method of approximations to deal with the problem of positional data formated in NMEA0183 received from GPS.

CDAWG is compact suffix automaton, which allows to index the text and perform searching in it in linear time with respect to length of the pattern. The optimisation is based on two main ideas: First, it takes advantage from small, four symbol alphabet of DNA. Next, it utilises the fact, that CDAWG build upon DNA text has specific distributions of values of its parameters. This distributions are rather independent on organism, from which DNA originate. The whole CDAWG is stored in single continuous block of memory - bit stream. Nodes of CDAWG are topologically ordered and transitions are stored as relative pointers to this bit stream. This pointers tends to be small, as topological ordering leaves related nodes close together. This topological ordering has also big influence on reduction of memory requirements of CDAWG.This thesis includes description and comparison of different implementation techniques for the development of massive multiplayer on-line games, which work as a client/server applications.

But it is suitable for testing all Ethernet based (100BASE-TX/10BASE-T) network devices. TempLab simulates net breaks (with a length between 30ns and 60s with step of 21ns). Net break sequence is synchronized by external signals. There are several modes for the net break sequence and the net break sequence can be repeated. TempLab implement centralized power switching of tested devices (up to 16) and monitor temperature at 16 places. TempLab device is managed via USB interface. USB interface allows use TempLab device with almost all now days PCs. TempLab device uses the HID driver for USB interface. The HID driver is present on most platforms and therefore TempLab is easy to use. There are two implementations of an application manager. One is for a console access, and another is a GUI application.This work describes basic features of genetic algorithms and their application in NP-hard problems solving.

QFA are together with quantum Turing machines and quantum cellular automata basic theoretical models of quantum computers. The main goal of this work is presentation of basic concepts, classify particular QFA models and results which have been achieved in this area. Quantum automata are compared with finite and probabilistic automata, important results are presented including proofs, and some examples of languages recognizable by QFA are also mentioned. Finally, relations among classes of languages which are recognizable by various automata models are presented.  In this work I deal with gathering information about some techniques used when generating

The tool available from a patient health card assists doctor with diagnostics of patient.In a few words music recognition is mathematical analysis of an audio
signal and its conversion into musical notation (usually in MIDI format). This is a very hard artificial intelligence problem. The programs of speech recognition already work with 70-80% accuracy, whereas the systems of music recognition work with 60-70% accuracy but only for a single voice melody (one note at a time). To create a MIDI file musician must determine pitch, velocity and duration of each note being played and record these parameters into a sequence of MIDI events. Even for a single instrument song it is not a simple task.Goal of this diploma work was to extend already existing Multimedia Information System in 3D Space - MISS and make it more user-friendly. This system helps users (students, foreigner visitors) to find any room or person in Department of Computer Science and Engineering.
Information system consist of  three parts, they are connected by web-presentation. First part - virtual tour - shows the way from Charles square to the building, where Department is. The tour consist of many stops, every stop is shown in picture and next way is detailed described. Next part brings plans of the floor of the building. They can be used for better orientation. The main part is 3D model of the Department, created in VRML and extended by other information objects. This model is generated by PHP scripts and reading of database.

Firsts extension of the MISS was model of the 2nd floor. Text describes how to prepare plans, how to put data into database, how to create new rooms. Before this work avatar (visitor) couldn\\\'t open doors, but he was teleported to other room. Now he can open doors and choose, if he want go there. This change had changed whole model, now is model driven by doors. They add or remove rooms into/from model using JavaScripts and VRML node InlineLoadControl. This save VRML browsers memory, because whole model is not  loaded in browser, but only one or two rooms. Newly is in model defined second floor. Special chapter is about modeling staircase, because it belongs to both floors and has some differences.

Next was created connection between VRML model and panoramic model (result of other diploma work). First deal was to find right places for info-tabs in model, then the tabs with links were placed into VRML model. If user click on them, he will see panoramic model (in format QuickTime VR).

In model are information tables with links to external web pages with timetables of the rooms, or teacher\\\'s official pages (WebIS).  Everyone can reach needed information in natural way. This work increased number of the tables and updated old links.

One of the faults of original system was not clear navigation system. So it was created completely new version. It offers to show up to 3 navigation arrows in model. Each could show way to different destination (room). Anyway, it is not obligate to follow them, user could anytime change way or choose different destination. Navigation system was created using java applet (and EAI interface), this applet communicate with VRML model. The shortest path in graph is found using Dijkstra algorithm. All data of the graph (position of arrows, direction etc.) are stored in database and are read by PHP scripts.

Another java applet was created to inform visitor about his position in the world. It shows map of the floor and little circle signs the point, where avatar is. Information about avatar\\\'s position sends VRML node ProximitySensor to applet.

Next interesting part is about optimalization data-transfer between client and server. VRML files are compressed, specially dynamic created description of the room. It is done by using PHP script, where all output of the script is stored in output buffer and compressed before transfer to server. Last parts offer ways, how to make system more useful. Also available is text about administration of the MISS and short HOW-TO create similar system.

System (its client side) was also tested on different computers. Test were focused on quality of the picture, stability, cpu and memory usage, volume of data transport between server and client. Results says, that MISS works well (about 40 frames per second) on common PC\\\'s (CPU 1,5GHz, 512 RAM ).In our work, we give a detailed background of the most important aspects of the known methods of free-form modeling by sketching. We focus on the use of sketching for intuitive modeling of free-form shapes. These shapes are naturally smooth and deformable and can be used for representing objects \\The baroque theatre, which is situated at the fifth courtyard ot the Èeský Krumlov castle, is original, completely preserved baroque theatre scene. The unique technology for changing the coulisses and other decorations were made by Viennese carpenter Lorenz Makh (more at [1]).
This graduation project is a part of long-lasting work, which runs as a collaboration of Fotogrametrical Laboratory of the Map and Cartography Department of the Civil Engineering Faculty of the Czech Technical University, Administrative Unit of the Èeský Krumlov Castle and the Foundation of the Baroque Castle. In previous years there was the aim to create a digital 3D model of the theatre (Picture no. 1), which should help with presentation, research and maintenance of the theatre in future. The whole project is called Living theatre (the same name as my work) - the result should be high dynamic spatial model of this unusual object. The Client, who assigned this project is Administrative Unit of the Èeský Krumlov Castle.

I chose the topic - Visualization of the baroque theatre in Èeský Krumlov - in year 2003. I converted the spatial data from format of Microstation program (DGN) to format VRML within one of school subjects. The main aim ot this semestral project was walking through the virtual model in real time with a sufficient continuity ot the show. This virtual model contained only the part of baroque theatre, which is in front of the stage.

This semestral project interested me so much, that I decided to carry on as far as it developed into a graduation project. The stage space was added to previosly created model and the whole work was extended with a program part. This means the neccesary base for investigation of the object.

The visualization fulfils requirements for easy usage of the 3D model. It means: usage of the well-known and well-tried format of data, the speed of displaying and walking through the model and a possibility of visualization at different computers ( so-called Removal ). The topic of the speed of displaying of virtual model is closely linked with specificity of the model. There is always a compromise between the speed and the specificity of the show. I accepted all these parametres at the real begining of the project.

There is still a big amount of technical equipement in the theatre, which is interestig for a research. It is neccesary to investigate these objects from different point of view and to search the continuity and possible relations among details. In real application it means to study plans, photographs and sketches, which are not open to public. The spatial imagination is neccesary as well. Prospective restauration and making copies is expensive. I would like to alert, that my project does not substitute the original possibilities of the object investigation, it only infillls the area with other possibilites.

One of the basic client´s requirements was the distance measurement (Picture no. 2). Within the scene there could be measured not only the distances of the two points, but also the distances of their nearest apexes of the chosen model. For a higher comfort during the work with the model it is neccesary to have specific tools for categorization according to different criterions. According to these it is possible to clearly search required elements of the model and work with them. The information about the elements of the model are closely connected with that - information in XML file.Tato práce se zabývá procedurálním modelováním krajiny.

Traditional GIS applications allow only composition of these information into 2D layers and their simple browsing. Any complex and deeper relations between GIS and the real world topology are missing. Other disadvantage is a lack of third dimension, which would allow objective, vivid or even realistic presentation of geographic information.

System, which would enable this, could find wide possibilities of application and usage in large number of scopes of human activities. For example in various types of visualization, in architecture, town and country planning and engineering, in tourism and navigation systems, emergency and security services.

Developers around the world are aware of that, and therefore development of 3D GIS improves quickly.

This thesis aims to make first insight into such systems and wants to analyze available cartographic data and to suggest and create suitable data structures for virtual reality visualizing. Also, on the base of that The Aerial Model of Prague will be created. This model will be presented from the above view (aerial view).

For this purpose two applications will be created:

   1. The Editor of Virtual City, which will be able to import available entry data and convert them.
   2. Viewer of the Virtual City. That will be used to present data to user in maximum possible level of reality. 

First necessary step is to define structures suitable for geometric and topologic representation of information and present them on a virtual town model with using a large amount of data. Next step is to create algorithms that will convert entry data into the form of these scriptures. At the end, it is necessary to suggest the way to generate level of details of the town model and to design and produce data representation suitable for real-time browsing.As we know, virtual human characters use has been spreading widely in recent years. These characters should be moving and we want them to move realistically. Real human motion is usually quite dependent on the emotional state of the person, performing the move. Although the influence of emotion is obviously projected to the kinematic parameters (speed, range) of the motion, it is quite difficult if not impossible to describe it in terms of these parameters. Thus, we can decide to consider the human emotional state (happiness, tiredness) to be just another parameter.

This decision becomes important if we want to apply some motion synthesis technique. Virtual humans can be animated using various approaches from keyframing to motion capture, but in each case, we have to create (record) each particular motion. The need for wide variety of animations of the same class (varying step-length of character walking in uneven terrain) leads to the situation when motion capturing or animating is just a waste of resources and another way is sought after. The motion synthesis (or parameterization) is a process of creating new animation varying in a specific parameter. This parameter can be  step-length as well as emotional influence elusive by nature. In motion parameterization process we typically create new animations out of some basic set of animations representing typical examples of our desired parameters. If these parameters are of the emotional kind, this set should be a set of recorded motions that we label as influenced by particular emotion.

The next step was to produce our own approach. Based on our ideas and on the performed survey of methods we have produced method and application for human motion and emotion parameterization.

Our approach:

At first, we select a range of animations. Then we split each of these animations  into separated steps. Then we select two steps and we make an interpolation or extrapolation between them. Thus, we get new step. The procedure is repeated for other steps. Finally, by merging of the steps we get new generated animation.

By tests, we have discovered that the real sense of the new generated animation not only depends on the quality of selected approach. It also depends on the ability of user to select suitable parameter of parameterization. Only in this case can be new generated animation realistic.  Bi-directional reflectance distribution function, shortly BRDF, is one of the ways, how to describe, how much of light incoming from one direction is reflected into the second direction.

Since the beginnings of the computer graphics scientist have tried to develop approaches, which would enable them to create images indistinguishable for originals. One of the most important characteristics for a human perception is how an object reflects light, because this way we get information about a depth of a picture.

There were created many methods of light passage through a scene and more-or-less accurate models of a light reflection on a surface. The main problem of these efforts remains till today - big computational complexity of algorithms, which makes an image synthesis very slow. This is the reason why there are still used old, simple, and inexact models, especially in real-time applications.

The main goal of this work is to review the current state of this issue. For a simpler understanding of the complicated models there were described even older illumination models in this work that were not defined by the BRDF.

 

At the beginning this works describes a basics from a light reflection, like a perfect mirror reflection, diffuse reflection, and a real reflection.

In computer graphics, many models are approaching to the light reflection, as it would be consisted of a three parts: Ambient reflection, diffuse reflection, and specular reflection (sometimes is used also a directional-specular reflection). Ambient part of the reflection represents a part of light that originates from many scatters in a scene. It is uniformly spread out in the scene and reflects the same way from the objects in all directions. A diffuse part and a specular part are allied with concrete light sources. This approach simplifies a view on the model and in many cases this does not make a difference. This is for example a case of plastic materials. In contrast, this is unnecessary with metals or even fails in case of polished materials. This part is described in detail in a part dividing models due their capabilities.

Another part of the theoretic introduction of this work is dedicated to methods of ray casting and ray tracing, followed by mathematical basics of a Monte Carlo integration. There is described an importance sampling technique and its relationship with BRDFs. Briefly there are mentioned the other methods of sampling as well.

Probably the most often way how the illumination models are described is Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (shortly BRDF). This work gives an explanation of this function with its constraints: Helmhotz reciprocity, conservation of energy, and non-negativity for all directions over hemisphere.

The main part of this work contains a description of illumination models, if it is possible, using the BRDF. It divides them due the isotropy of a surface to isotropic models and anisotropic models as well as due to the physical background on pure empirical models, models based on a ray optics, and models based on a wave optics.

There are described 15 models. The Blinn\\\'s model is described in the section of the Torrance and Sparrow model because their similarity.

Historically, the first illumination model was proposed by Lambert over 200 years ago.

The most often used model till today remains the Phong illumination model proposed in 1975. It is only an empirical model without a deeper physical validity but it is very popular because of its simplicity and easy hardware implementation.

This model was modified by Lewis to fulfill the conservation law and Helmholtz reciprocity and several more time enhanced to give more trustworthy view of different materials.

A widespread model was proposed by Torrance and Sparrow. This model is, opposite to the Phong\\\'s model, based on an idea that we can image that the surface is made from a collection of long V-cavities created from perfect mirrors. This enables effects like a masking, shadowing or off-specular reflection.

Blinn has further modified this model to decrease its computational expenses.

Oren and Nayar used long V-cavities, this time made from the perfectly diffuse planes, to model non-Lambetian surfaces.

Poulin and Fournier have made an anisotropic model a similar way, expecting that the surface consist of very small cylinders.

Kajiya has come up with a very computationally expensive anisotropic model base on the Kirchhoff laws.

He et al published a very comprehensive model. Unfortunately, it is as well computationally expensive while it contains a very slowly tending series.

Many modern BRDF models come out from the models of Lewis and Blinn and try to involve to them the new capabilities. Such models are for example Neumann, Neumann, Szirmay-Kalos for metals and anisotropic model Ashikhmin, Shirley. Very complex model based on an approximation of the Blinn \\\'s model presented Schlick. This model is suitable even for materials consisting form more layers.

One of a very few models based on a wave optics was announced by Gondek, Mayer and Newman.

From the empirical models should be mentioned also Ward model that is anisotropic, very simple and fast.

Shirley, Hu, Smits and Lafortune have created a nice model for materials where a ratio between the diffuse and the specular reflection is highly dependent on the angle of incidence.

With a new models there came up also a question of their representation. This problem is also spoken in this work.

 

The second goal of this work was to create a library, which would implement the most of described models. From the 15 models explained in this work, 12 models were implemented. To be able to compare the models, it has been written an interactive modeler that makes possible to demonstrate a behavior of each BRDF on basic shapes in a simple scene. It is possible to interactively modify lighting parameters as well as parameters of the BRDF and see the visual consequences on the scene so this program can be also used as a learning tool for students of computer graphics.

The printed part of the work contains a comprehensive description of the program implementation and it is divided into a library part and a GUI.

After this follows an overview of the program environment and a final part discussing the results. It was measured a compared 12 models. To each model there are written its positives and negatives and possibilities of usage. The work has many pictures of objects and BRDF created in this demonstration program showing characteristics of models.

 

The model library can be easily extended with new models in the future so it gives a space for continuation in this field. This diploma thesis is focused on 3D object reconstruction using 2D slices. In this case it means reconstruction based only on contours, including the possibility of hollow space. For better orientation in methods for 3D object reconstruction, other approaches of reconstruction and data representation are mentioned. This work describes possibilities of processing parallel and non-parallel slices, computing methods, optimizations, problems and their solutions. Concrete application is focused on fast processing of input data sampled with bigger inaccuracy. Reconstruction is being performed by transforming contours into the volume grid, which is later visualized with help of Marching cubes algorithm. Additional improvement algorithms to get better surface are engaged and their efficiencies were measured.

During my work, I evolved from direct contour-to-contour tessellation, which is difficult to be well implemented and ended with very popular volume representation, which is being processed using Marching cubes algorithm. I have developed certain techniques like contour fit, which helps the contour to better fit into 3D volume grid, matter linear interpolation applied on sandwich-like slices, where the inner slice is much smaller, I have used dilatation to pull denser values onto the surface and I experimented with smooth filters. This theme still deserves a lot work to be done and certain perspective ideas were invented.
I hope this work will help all, who want to understand the 3D object reconstruction problem.The goal of this thesis is the platform that enables to program a chatterbot, i.e. an interactive dialog program, in virtual world of blaxxun Community Platform from Blaxxun. The concept is based upon science researches in artificial intelligence discipline, mainly focused on natural language processing resp. understanding and knowledge representation branches. The dialog is managed in written czech language.The diploma thesis contains a requirement analysis, design, implementation and testing of an information system for a trade and transport company. The target environment for storing data of the information system is expected to be a small database system (a Microsoft Access demo implementation has been prepared). 
The information system helps to manage the company (that means it plans the transport of the deliveries  and the movement of goods between warehouses, for which it also prepares a plan of instructions for the means of transport). It records the information about the means of transport and its maintenance, about fixed assets and equipment, including any repairs made, the staff and their qualification. The main benefit may be seen in the planning of transport for moving the goods between the locations by the client. 
In the future the system (after further enhancements) can have additional in-built functionalities (e.g. network connection with other transport providers in case of a hired means of transport). In addition, it would be able to integrate with other systems (e.g. accounting record system, etc.) and it could have a more sophisticated delivery transport scheduler which would make better use of the means of transport, it could move separate parts of the delivery between warehouses without the need to have the complete delivery in the warehouse, and other improvements. The goal of this thesis is to create the application for support the Object Behaviour Analysis method. The Object Behaviour Analysis method (OBA method) is a modern object oriented method for the opening phase of projecting of information systems, whose main users are mainly managers, business and informative analysts of bigger companies, which project object oriented conceptions of informative systems and new management methods with its employ. The OBA method’s results are the first source of information for professional software realisation companies, which are able to expand and develop the opening study created with OBA method’s to larger conceptions and systems more effectively and faster. The demand for creation application for support OBA method has been arisen just from the side of business analysts and managers, because many of them use OBA method only with the help of standard office programs, which doesn’t allow to use all possibilities and advantages of OBA method effectively enough. Application for support of OBA method will be implemented in object oriented development environment VisualWorks/Smalltalk. 
The final product will be used also in education on the Faculty of Agricultural Economics and Management of Czech University of Agriculture Prague (CUA), where will be a help for students studying OBA method and projecting. 
The thesis can be divided into two parts, theoretical and practical. Theoretical part is built as research with the use of mentioned literature. Practical part includes own solution of author’s work with the use of all necessary knowledge of theoretical part. To theoretical part belong chapters: 2. OBA metoda, 3. Modelovací jazyk UML a 4. Vývojové prostøedí VisualWorks – Smalltalk. Practical part of the thesis includes these chapters: 5. Aplikace „Podpora OBA metody“  a  6. Vyu¾ití aplikace pro návrh IS. In the enclosure of the work is to disposition: the user manual for the created application, the application outputs for a concrete theme of project of information system and management methods.   Graph editor is a tool for manipulating and visualizing of graphs
and graph algorithms on the Win32 platform. The ability to change
dynamically graph visual and structure parameters makes the graph
editor able to animate graph algorithms. The composition of
visualizing operations and graph algorithms is based on dynamic
linking libraries. The graph editor uses a structured text format
for storing graphs in files. This format can be easily read and
has minimum redundancy in accordance to preserve readability.

This tool is designated for learning purposes and for presentation
of graph algorithms.This diploma thesis focuses on production line optimization problems. We propose an algorithm for batching, which computes number of batches and returns suboptimal solution of our batching problem in polynomial time for one  and multiple types of products. Batches are then scheduled by MILP on one or multiple sources, where weighted tardiness of batches and setup times are minimized. Furthermore we introduce two methods on how to export data from software for planning and controlling SAP, which is widely used by many companies worldwide. All algorithms were implemented in MATLAB, where they were also tested and evaluated on exported and generated data.This thesis deals with design and implementation of industrial communication protocol
(DLMS/COSEM) which is defined in set of norms ÈSN EN 62056. Next necessary
standards and norms used by this protocol and their design and implementations are
completely or partially described. Result of this work is C++ library which is transferrable
on source code level between operating systems (Windows, Linux abd RTX)
and includes necessary part to collect data from devices in AMM networks.
As side product was created a library which implements profile of HDLC protocol
which interconnects with protocol DLMS and which is used by functions of DLMS protocol.
Within framework DLMS/COSEM was created group of classes which implements
necessary part of ASN.1 standard which is used to describe syntax of DLMS protocol.
It is possible to extend and develop this library to use it in another protocol implementations
which uses ASN.1 to describe own syntax.
The master thesis deals with the solving NP-hard problem for the Resource Constrained
Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) by a genetic algorithm. The core of the thesis is a
design and its implementation of algorithm using the latest graphical cards. This thesis
comes with a way to use several graphical cards at the same time for solving RCPSP by
the genetic algorithm. The thesis also includes an implementation of the same algorithm
for CPU without using graphical cards. This thesis aims to improve the quality of solving
instances of problem RCPSP and the speedup of computing. The implementations were
tested on a set of standard problems of RCPSP and compared to other implementations
from the literature.
This work describes the design procedure for a non-contact planar manipulation of micro- and mesoscopic objects using dielectrophoresis. Specifically, it documents the use of commercially available matrix microelectrode array. For it, I created mathematical simulation models using the method of moments, and I used these for debugging of simple position controllers. I verified the functionality in laboratory experiments handling polystyrene microspheres. A prerequisite for these experiments was also my successful resolution of contacting electrode array and a voltage generator.This thesis presents an heuristic algorithm for dynamic scheduling of non-preemptive tasks with precedences on an arbitrary number of orthogonal resources, where the resource allocation is continuous. It is based on two data structures: critical-path task graph structure and constructive Container Loading Problem packing structure with an approach called ``Skyline''. Both structures have been extended to support the algorithm. Algorithm complexity and computational results are shown.The work deals with an extension of a driver for the RTD SDM8540HR-1 card. That is an PCI/104 I/O module. The former version had been developed within my bychelor's thesis. The current driver implements a new approach of internal synchronization. It is possible to take samples from A/D converter more than once during one RT period thanks to this change. The basic configuration of the card has been also modified to be able to shorten RT period below 200 us. It also implements a system for measured values logging with configurable start/stop condition. All user functions are included in one static library called SDM8540.lib. Since the C language lacks the namespace support, names of all functions start with the SDM8540_ or LOG_ prefix because of better transparency for the user programmed source code. The driver is supposed to be used with the 2nd generation of the real-time kernel developed by R. Martínek and it isn't compatible with its previous version. The driver is designed to be used in a real-time system.This thesis is dedicated to the issue of a computer simulation of the production line. First, it analyzes the generic production line and its parameters. Based on this analysis, the methodology of simulating the generic production line is proposed. The Petri net mathematical apparatus was used for the simulator creation. Using this net, the simulator can realistically mimic all the characteristics of the production line. The implementation is done in C# language. This text also contains the results of testing on a production line and the discussion of achieved results.The goal of work “Implementation of unconventional CAN controller in VHDL language” is to design a circuit with IP CAN bus controller function with above-standard functionality in VHDL language. In addition to the functioning of standard CAN bus controller our circuit implements queue of incoming messages and four queues for messages to be sent. Furthermore it assigns timestamps to all received messages and for all messages to be sent it is possible to determine at what time these messages are to be sent to the CAN bus.This bachelor thesis presents the algorithm for video image analysis which is being used for relative localization of micro aerial vehicles by the IMR group. It also describes the approach to modify this algorithm so it can be used for localization in robotic swarm. Theoretical part of the thesis deals with field of robotics and the basic categorization of robots. Subsequent chapter provides the necessary information concerning the mobile robot localization. In particular, the principles of visual localization and localization of multi-robot systems are presented. Practical part of the presented work deals with the system SyRoTek and its localization modul. Next part is devoted to principles of pattern detection, geometry of the operational space and computational complexity of the aforementioned localization algorithm. Then two different ways to approach needed modifications of algorithm are presented. Proposed solutions are implemented and their computational complexity is compared. Last part of the thesis present comparation of error of relative distance estimation of SyRoTek modul and modified algorithm.The aim of this project is the design and implementation of software gateway USB/CAN based on single chip processor with ARM7TDMI core and integrated controllers CAN and USB.

It is a scheduling with alternative process plans subject to the total setup costs minimization, where setup times are sequent-dependent. The considered problem further covers many nowadays and practical constraints such as non-unary resources, release times and deadlines or generalized precedence relations known as time lags. This thesis also includes very detailed review of related works. An exact mathematical model is described, which can be used to solve small instances and a new heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve large instances of the considered problem. The algorithm is then implemented using programming language C# with an emphasis on efficiency and low computational demands. In the end, the proposed algorithm is tested on the wide variety of instances with regard to the time performance and the value of the objective function comparison with existing algorithms and benchmarks.Diploma thesis describes a FlexRay communication system and propose an algorithm for scheduling signals in the static segment of FlexRay network with graphical display possibility of the resulting communication schedule.

The thesis contains a detailed description of the NMF as a method for parametric model creation including relation to NMF interpretation as model whose formalisms allows to use the NMF for a modeling mind processes.

The thesis contains proof of equivalence of the NMF and an algorithm known as Expectation-Maximization (EM).

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRhW1NPRn0g&amp;hd=1The crawlers have great potential to be successful in a rough environment due to their high motion capabilities. Along with other internal or external sensors like range-finder, force sensitive sensors, camera, etc., the robot can become an autonomous agent with very high efficiency.

In contrast with other approaches, a mass produced hexapod robot without any additional sensors is used in this thesis. The only information about the environment comes from its own actuators.

A custom gait which allows the robot traversing rough terrain based on the internal sensors only and with continuous support of at least five legs is developed for this robot.This diploma thesis investigates the topic of intelligent optimisation of schedules for charging and discharging of electric vehicles (EVs). At first, we carry out a research on related topics of Smart Grids and vehicle-to-grid transactions, and then, we examine existing studies solving the problem, including an application of a binary particle swarm optimisation (BPSO). Subsequently, disadvantages and weaknesses of the investigated methods are identified.

We then reformulate the problem definition and its representation to dispose of the major drawbacks identified before. The modified formulation emerges a continuous optimisation problem, which for we propose a particle swarm optimisation (PSO) application. To eliminate remaining drawbacks, the algorithm implements a penalty function for penalising inconsistent solutions, and an alternative fitness function reflecting the battery degradation costs.

Finally, the implemented algorithm is confronted with the BPSO method, and it is verified that the proposed PSO implementation significantly outperforms the other algorithm in terms of quality of the best found solutions, and in terms of time efficiency as well.Due to the ubiquitous presence of
interference and a need for a large
angular resolution, the current radioas-
tronomical observations are carried out
using multi-antennas receiver systems.
Construction of such devices places
great demands upon the quality of
signal processing. A source of inspi-
ration for my diploma thesis has been
my own amateur radioastronomical
activity in the field of meteor observa-
tions. The thesis deals with a possible
realization of a digitization unit for a
radioastronomical signal receiver. The
implementation described in the thesis
is optimized for a high dynamic range
and good phase stability, both being
the most important parameters for
its application in the multi-antennas
systems. Design and the instrument
implementation have been created as
open-source hardware solutions, so far
having unique characteristics among
the devices used in amateur or profes-
sional radioastronomy. I have devised
and implemented a trial version and
made further experiments with it. A
resulting recommendations for repeated
implementations of the receivers, that
we are planing to use in the amateur
meteor observing networks, are based
on these experiencesThe aim of this thesis is design and implementation of a management tool for the operational monitoring of manufacturing processes.

New calibration performs well both on simlated data and real data.
This master thesis deals with the reverse engineering of web applications and especially creating a finite state machine of a given web application.

The thesis discusses the issues of automated construction of the abovementioned finite state machine, identification of interactive elements on a web page and state comparison. It presents both existing and newly developed methods for comparing states. Within the scope of this thesis, a new tool for semi-automated construction of the finite state machine has been developed. The tool has been used to perform experiments focusing on various comparison methods on a sample web application.

The main focus is put on random sampling techniques for an estimation of two-view geometries, in particular homography and epipolar geometry, in a presence of outliers. After a thorough analysis of LO-RANSAC, several improvements are proposed to make it more robust to the selection of the inlier/outlier error threshold and to the number of points. A new estimator, faster, more accurate and more robust that the state-of-the-art is the result. The improvements were implemented in the framework of CMP WBS-Demo and extensively tuned and experimentally tested on diverse data, using a newly created testing framework. The LO-RANSAC implementation for homography and epipolar geometry estimation has been separated from the rest of WBS-Demo and is now publicly available. The datasets were made available as well, including new manually annotated ground truth point correspondences.The goal of this thesis is to modify the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to allow its use with small UAVs and utilize it for the task of locating the source of a smoke. Since the PSO algorithm requires the swarm individuals to know their immediate position, several means of absolute localization of the robots have to be devised and used. In order to avoid collisions, a means of relative robot localization must be used. First, a simple version of the PSO algorithm using particles with no constraints will be used in combination with a simple fitness function. After tuning the algorithm's parameters, it will be used to find a source of a smoke and further tested. Then, the PSO algorithm modified using the real quadrotor constraints will be tested with the same basic fitness function. Eventually, the combination of these two approaches will yield an algorithm applicable on real quadrotors and the task of locating a smoke source.This thesis is dedicated to the issue of a computer simulation of the production line.

The thesis includes solutions to few tasks which deal with the robot spatial orientation. Their focus corresponds to the objectives of HUMAVIPS project. Two applications extending the robot\\\'s navigation abilities were proposed and implemented. First one allows the robot to track a set of special graphical landmarks creating a path. Second one brings a possibility to detect a position of obstacles marked by graphical symbols. From detected objects it creates a map in which it can find the shortest path. During the applications creation the overall usefulness and benefit of the simulator were evaluated. The evaluation is mainly aimed to the possibility of transferring an application on a real robot. Some problems caused by using the simulator were revealed. The thesis deals with them as well. The thesis takes part in a bilateral Czech-Argentinean project which aims to develop a framework intended for managing execution of data mining experiments within a GRID environment. The main goal of the thesis is to propose and subsequently validate a method for semi automatic construction of workflows representing data mining experiments. The proposed method constructs workflows combining two sources: experiment structure expressed as a template, and a set of user rules which designate transformation of the template into the final workflow. Our effort results in the proposition of ontology-based formalisation expressed in OWL language which determines the form of experiment definition as well as of the user transformation rules. We have also implemented an algorithm in Java which performs the template transformation and produces a workflow represented as a directed acyclic graph. To prove workflows being generated correctly we have also implemented a component for sequential workflow execution on a local computer. The second part of the thesis deals with the practical case study in order to validate results of the first part. We reconstruct a workflow of publicly available application XGENE.ORG using the proposed method and compare resulting outputs with those generated by the original version of the application.POEMS algorithm achieves fairly good results in many tasks. Using an evolutionary algorithm evolving sequence of actions improving solutions, which is usually initialized at random, it can quickly converge to a global optimum in problems without a large number of local extremes. However, if the problem contains such extremes there is a high probability that the algorithm tends to converge to one of the local optima and the calculation stagnates.

This work investigates some possible extensions of the POEMS algorithm. The extension is inspired by the list used in Taboo search, where list of solutions, that are fatally penalized for choosing the new one, is implemented. All solutions that have already passed the algorithm are added to this list, thus preventing the return to the known solutions. Another extension is multiprototype POEMS version, which improves the algorithm from several different solutions and have the opportunity to explore a larger portion of searched space. Last version is the combination of two previous extensions - multiprototype taboo version, in which proceeds from a number of solutions, while penalizing them, to avoid their fusion. Experiments have shown that they are more successful than the original version of the algorithm when the problem contains many local extremes.The first task is to create a simulation of electrocardiogram (ECG) of selected pathological heart rhythm.

The goal of this thesis is an agent which builds and maintains a relational and ontologic database of genomic knowledge. This knowledge base will subsequently serve as the source of background knowledge for sakes of classification. There is a large quantity of public bioinformatic knowledge sources, but these are very  heterogenous, and thus it is not easy to integrate the respective content sourced from them. In the web space, more than ten public bioinformatic databases  are available, which compete, complement each other and collaborate. It is thus a challenge to meaningfully  merge the available information to maximally exploit it in classification tasks. In this work we demonstrate that semantic knowledge technologies offer suitable means for integration of various relevant  bioinformatic data, for their further analysis through  machine learning methods. We further augment this semantic approach by technologies enabling inductive  logic programming systems to directly access the  content of the constructed semantic bioinformatic knowledge base, in their native relational representation. From experiments, we conclude that semantic web technologies provide principally suitable means for genomic data integration, but are currently inacceptably slow for sakes of data mining support. Therefore, more efficient implementations will be required by data miners in the next developments of this young technology.Aim that baccalaureate work was creates software tool susceptible writing short text news through system I4CONTROL.

But especially the knowledge of complete polarization characteristic can determine the use of particular antenna.
 The simplest method called polarization-pattern method was chosen from various techniques used for polarization measurements. It provides enough information to determine the polarization ellipse of measured antenna.
The measurement is enabled by the use of a polarization rotator, which was equipped with a stepping motor controlled by its control unit. The position of the polarization rotator is set by a DLL library, which was added to the main program used for measuring antenna’s characteristics. This program also processes measured values.
The measurement system could be improved by adding a position sensor and a microcontroller which would process data from the sensor and which would also control the position of the polarization rotator.
This task due to its broad area of interest brought a lot of theoretical knowledge from the field of polarization measurement and also a lot of experience with the realization of measurement systems.

An alternative is to generate the keys “on-the-fly” by using the inherent uniqueness of a device based on the manufacturing process variations. This is realized by Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). 
A promising approach is to construct an intrinsic PUF based on the 
Static Random Access Memory, since many electronic devices have embedded SRAM. However, using a SRAM as a PUF requires stability of the SRAM cells under a wide variety of conditions, moreover the SRAM output must be unique. 
The aim of this thesis is to design the PUF concept based on one of 
the popular Atmel AVR microcontrollers. During the work the evaluation of PUF properties of the test chips is discussed. Proposed PUF-design is suitable for using in two application scenarios: chip identification and key generation. The SRAM output is not stable enough for that various post- and pre-processing techniques are analyzed to make the concept suitable for key generation scenarios. 
The major contributions of the current research is the new measurements performed on an Atmel AVR microcontroller, many researches have focused mostly on FPGA so far. This work estimates the entropy of a PUF in a 16Kbyte SRAM output in order to uniquely identify each of Atmel ATmega1284P microcontrollers. Furthermore, after applying postprocessing error correction, proposed SRAM-based PUF can be used to generate a stable 4Kbit key.

The number of available process modeling methods and methodologies is very large and the right choice is a crucial prerequisite to success of projects.
In this thesis, the focus is on BORM (Business Object Relationship Modelling), BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) and DEMO (Design and Engineering Methodology for Organizations). Their advantages and strengths are analyzed and a recommendation of applicability of each is proposed in relation to identified purposes and usage of process modeling. Furthermore, they are assessed in how they support simulation, which plays an important role in the BPM projects, since it allows to conduct a performance analysis and to visualize the process flow and thus helps validate the process. The methodologies are very different, yet they should not be regarded as competitive approaches – on the contrary, in some ways, they may complement each other.
The DEMO methodology does not support simulation, which is considered as its drawback. Therefore, a part of this thesis is dedicated to developing a method of translating the DEMO model into a Petri net simu-lation model, the latter one having proved to be suitable for simulating workflows. The basis of the method contains an analysis of information needed to build a Petri net model. The method itself constitutes a set of modeling constructs. The created Petri net model can be applied to visualizing the process flow as well as to the performance analysis.This bachelor work deals with the creation of ERP management system for small business, which is primarily responsible for accounting, client ma-nagement and project management.

The quality of their design therefore directly affects the quality of the information system as a whole.

Conventional design of logical circuits is based on available knowledge and/or creating a complex logic function out of already existing parts. It is for this reason that this design is limited only to circuits intuitive enough to be designed by a human, which may not always be optimal. As a result, this problem creates the issue of automatization of logic circuits' design in order to avoid these limitations and conventional practices.

Cartesian Genetic Programming serves this purpose. This thesis examines its principles, possibilities, limitations, configuration and its influence on the algorithm's efficiency.Reputation systems become more and more important in the Internet communities because they are able to estimate trust and distrust among unknown users.

Nowdays the Internet is not only a~collection of pages referring to each other, but there are web applications which are loaded by a~browser and which interact with a~user without redirecting. These applications require additional technologies for sending and receiving data from web server. Unfortunately, HTTP protocol used on the Internet does not support duplex communication.

	A new protocol was created, WS, which is not used for transmission of a~web content, but for communication between web page and web server on background without an user notice. There are some techniques eliminating these deficiencies also.

	The bachelor’s project deals with these technologies and their comparison. Moreover, some techniques are implemented based on the research. The result of this work is the program, Exconn server, which works both on client side with a~web page and server side with a~web server. This technlogy enables duplex communication between these sides and providing simple API for web applications.

	A simple web application is also part of the project demonstrating the analysed technologies and showing benefits of duplex communication on the web.The bachelor’s thesis is concerned with usage of CSS frameworks and preprocessors on production of web interface.

The first approach is to generate UIs on the basis of code inspection (using JPA entities) represented by tool AspectFaces (formerly JFormBuilder). The second approach is to generate concrete UIs (CUIs) from abstract UIs (AUIs). An AUI describes UI in a platform independent matter. The CUI generation process reflects context, in particular user capabilities and characteristics of target devices. It is represented by UI generator (UiGE) that is part of the UIProtocol platform. There is a synergy of combination of UiGE and AspectFaces that has potential of eliminating their disadvantages as individuals. Using this approach AspectFaces can generate context sensitive UI for various heterogeneous platforms. On the other hand, UiGE with UIProtocol is enhanced by a powerful input model - enhanced data persistence model. The solution is integrated into the Java version of the UIProtocol platform.This thesis deals with design and realization of a plug-in for MediaWiki
